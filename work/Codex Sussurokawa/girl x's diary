THE DOOR IS OPEN

Alexa is led to the slaughterhouse because she sees the shadows run around



Everyone thinks the children are being stolen away. Kidnapped. Even in the past. Alexa is smart enough to know they're being 'spirited away' probably, but even in her precocious maturity she's shocked by the reality of it. 

Alexa hates apples

Alexa isn't a mother who realized she wasn't cut out to be one. She's someone who had always intended Mekuru as a sacrificial lamb, but started feeling for her. That's why the IVF thing is important, actually

this means that there needs to be a beat about alexa trying to escape. 	

Girl x, aka alexa, swears she can see worms in the apples

It's funny but you know... She's right. It's the kiddy insults that hurt the most."
