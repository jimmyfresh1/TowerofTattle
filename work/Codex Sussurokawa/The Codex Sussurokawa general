The consumption cipher is introduced with Girl X 1 eating Netabare 1. This is the only one where the consumption cipher is directly on the journals. This is to establish the device. When they first find Netabare 1 they're annoyed and thinking it's more nonsense. They're shocked to see that Girl X changes so radically, because it was seemingly coherent. Or maybe not that one. I'm not sure. We need to pull that trick at least once though.

mekuru and shiori passively note which journals seem like gibberish

The Final Showdown that Constitutes part VII is framed as the final game of find the magi. Part VIII we can just call the final final showdown. Desperation on Alexa's part. Naming her. The final trick is you have to connect ALL the dots. Shiori and Mekuru try to name her, but keep failing. They call her Arekusa Netabare, and it doesn't work, and Mekuru tears her hair out until she realizes it.


Hana knows better eventually, but keeps playing Judas goat. Tries to kill her mother. Terrified of being killed herself. Therefore thinks it's best if the children can simply be put to sleep before... like lambs. Hana was forced to eat her mother. Compelled to eat it magically? 'A dish you can't stop eating, even if you want to. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.'


Old enough to join the fun and games, Eris acts like a ... groomer, essentially. I seem to remember her always being 'one of the kids' Hanari mused

Eris was seemingly perfect and tranquil. This covered up what an awful person she was.


Bleeding Cone


Hana, out of desperation, challenges her mother so that she can become the new manager of the games. She beats her mother in a challenge of their basic powers. And is fed her mother. "You've done a foolish thing." 

How did eris taste lol: like bamboo shoots with blood, earthy, nutty, like  a forest after rain, with sudden tastes of iron.



Waechner designed the underground. Waechner is a family architect of sorts. With his 'handler' helicches

Demonic Possession parallels. This is why many townspeople fear Shiori. People acting as if possessed.

Hanari was instrumental in her father's project. But also: "It's a foolish thing you've done, Hanari."

The concept of a "posthumous seizure" in the strictest sense — a seizure that happens after clinical death — is not recognized in modern medicine. Once brain activity ceases, the complex neural processes that underlie a seizure cannot occur.

However, there are a few related phenomena to consider:

Agonal Convulsions: After death, particularly if the cause of death is traumatic or sudden, the body can exhibit involuntary muscle twitching or spasmodic movements. These are not seizures, but they might appear seizure-like to laypeople. They are caused by remaining neural energy and chemical processes in the cells.

Lazarus sign: This is a reflex movement in brain-dead patients, which can cause the arms to rise, briefly cross, and then fall. It's not a seizure but rather a spinal reflex. The Lazarus sign can be distressing to witness, especially for those unfamiliar with it, as it might give the false impression of a return to consciousness or life.

Cadaveric Spasm: This is a rare form of muscular stiffening that occurs at the moment of death and persists into the rigor mortis. It's thought to occur in cases of sudden death and might be related to a high level of adrenaline in the muscles. This is more of a sustained contraction than a convulsion.

It's worth noting that in literature, film, and other media, the line between reality and fiction can blur, and posthumous movements might be exaggerated or misrepresented for dramatic effect. If you're considering using such a phenomenon in a story, you have some room for creative interpretation, especially if you're aiming to unsettle or surprise the reader.

Galvanic Reanimation: In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, scientists like Luigi Galvani and Giovanni Aldini experimented with electricity and dead bodies, showing that muscles twitched when subjected to electrical stimulation. Aldini even performed public demonstrations on executed criminals, making it seem as though the bodies were momentarily reanimated. These experiments partly inspired Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein."

Hangings: After public hangings, especially if the drop was not sufficient to break the neck, the condemned would sometimes twitch and spasm for several minutes. These movements were involuntary and resulted from the body's nervous system reacting to the lack of oxygen.


**You:**

i see. so cadaveric spasms and twitching are actually associated with hanging? that actually works well in my favor. is this well documented?

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Yes, cadaveric spasms can sometimes be associated with hangings, especially in cases where the hanging doesn't result in an immediate broken neck. Instead, if strangulation is the primary cause of death in the hanging, the body can display involuntary muscle movements or twitching due to a combination of nervous system responses and lack of oxygen to the brain.

While cadaveric spasms in hangings are mentioned in forensic literature, they are not as commonly discussed as other aspects of hangings (like the characteristic ligature mark). The spasms themselves are a subject of forensic interest because they can provide clues about the circumstances of death. For example, the presence of a weapon still gripped tightly in the hand of a deceased person might indicate a cadaveric spasm and can provide insights into the moments immediately before death.

Koi Fish:

Origin and Distribution: Koi (Cyprinus rubrofuscus) originally came from Central Asia (around the Black, Caspian, and Aral Seas). They were introduced to China and later Japan, where they were primarily raised for food. Over time, they were selectively bred in Japan for their distinct and vibrant colors, leading to the ornamental koi we're familiar with today. While koi are now found worldwide in decorative ponds and water gardens, they hold special significance in Japan.

Symbolism:

Longevity: Koi can live a long time, some even reaching ages of 100 years or more under the right conditions. Therefore, they symbolize longevity in various cultures.
Perseverance: Their ability to swim upstream against the current, especially during their breeding season, signifies determination and overcoming adversity. This symbolism is particularly poignant in tales of the koi fish transforming into a dragon after successfully swimming upstream.
Prosperity and Success: Particularly in Asian cultures, koi are considered symbols of wealth and prosperity.
Love and Friendship: In Japan, the koi is also a symbol of love and friendship.

Culinary Use: While ornamental koi are primarily kept for decorative purposes, koi were originally grown for consumption in Asia. That said, ornamental koi are not typically eaten, especially given their value and significance.

Eels:

Distribution: Eels are found in both freshwater and saltwater, depending on the species. They can be found worldwide, from the rivers of Europe to the Pacific islands.

Symbolism:

Transformation and Adaptability: Given their life cycle, where they often migrate between freshwater and saltwater, eels can symbolize change, transformation, and adaptability.
Mystery: Due to their elusive nature and nocturnal habits, eels can also represent the unknown or the mysterious.

Culinary Use:

Eels are a delicacy in many cultures. In Japan, "unagi" (freshwater eel) is a popular dish, often grilled and served over rice. "Anago" (saltwater eel) is also consumed.
In Europe, particularly in the UK, jellied eels are a traditional dish.
The European eel is also popular in various Mediterranean cuisines.
In general, eels are a valuable food source in many parts of the world, with their flesh being rich, oily, and flavorful.

Both koi and eels have played significant roles in the cultures and cuisines of various regions, with their symbolism evolving based on local beliefs and observations.

Can't we just see how many words are bolded and compare them? "we don't even know which ones are eaten and not eaten though... "

**You:**

hmm. how's this soun dfor a dish. apeiro a-paella. a seafood paella that uses rice noodles instead of just rice, as noodles represent long life. the seafood included are eels, mysterious and virile and decadent, koi, also decadent bordering on irreverent, and then turtles, as they live the longest, and there is something a little evil about eating  atortoise
