**Mekuru's Diary, circa 5 years old **
I. You know diary, I noticed our house is really big. The biggest one. I was told good girls don't brag, so I won't. But how is it our house is so big on a single mother's income? I know all about economics, so I know that doesn't make sense. I've been thinking about why mom will never tell me about daddy. Mom must have done something bad, or be protecting him. I think that maybe he was a wayward princ-"

    Today a new girl came to town. I've never seen anyone as young as me. She's pretty. But I feel bad for her because she has to stay with Monika. No one in town likes Monika. I think she's Monika's niece.

    I don't know if we'll be friends, because she seems kind of baby-ish. I don't think she could take care of herself if she had to survive in the wilderness, for example, or had to do taxes. I don't exactly know how to do taxes, but I know enough about it that I'm sure I could. And I could probably survive in the wild for about two months. 

    Everyone in town likes her, especially everyone important on Rumeuri Hill. I think that's good. She's a good child. I'm a good child, too, but not in the way that's fun for adults. They worry about me more than they have fun with me. I'm glad they can have a normal girl, so they can have fun like normal adults looking at sunsets and smelling flowers and all that stuff I can't stand.

    Today she really upset me so I let her know very maturely that she shouldn't act like a know-it-all.

    Sometimes right when it gets dark I feel so sad and empty. I don't know why. I hate it but maybe I don't, because lately I don't really feel it. 

    I tried to ask mom about it but she just looked bewildered and said maybe we could talk to Kyrie about it. I think she hates the idea of being helped by Kyrie though. Does my mom hate psycholigists? I don't know. I don't know how much mom likes anything exept working.
