What happens when something important cracks? 

What's a child try to do? They rush to find something to glue it back together. They'll tape it up from the inside so nobody notices. They'll hurt themselves with the super glue and tear their skin off. 

They'll probably drop it once or twice and break it even more. 

Adults have the emotional adaptability to put themselves back together in ways that children don't.

Well... (looking at the archaic human). It's strange. It's literary, yet utterly childish. It's childish, but filled with a very adult... hatred. 

---
Sometimes the first truly adult emotion someone learns is hate.

<p>                        Now that I think about it, maybe that's why I was so childishly infatuated with maturity and capability. I must have just been trying my best to imitate my mom. Still, I can't help but feel like there was something else to it... Ugh. Seriously though, did I actually think I could survive in the wild for two months?</p>

                        <p>"You always were talking about 'taxes' and 'finances' and 'economics' for some reason. You know, for a little kid you were really obsessed with money management. Like here!" Shiori gets on her tip toes to grab a huge book off the shelf. "You always lugged this book around! Like you were actually reading it!"</p>

                        <p>Shiori flips it open to a random page.</p>

                        <p><u><strong>Fiscal Policy in an Increasingly Globalized World: Strategy for Competing with Multinationals</strong></u></p>

                        <p id="quote2">Foreign Direct Investment is not simply the purview of monolithic multinationals. FDI constitutes and facilitates the economy of the modern world. As the world enters the 21st century, markets can no longer be considered lakes and ponds with no crossover or spillage. Firms that choose to engage in FDI enter a complex net of regulatory frameworks, whereby red tape can either entrap a firm into needless litigation, or be cut through so long as the firm offers the promise of innovation that the recipient country can absorb, adapt, and diffuse. The national firm operates within the strict lines of 'law', but the international firm must gracefully navigate culture and institutions. Investment deals with lead negotiation times of years up to a full decade are can be reneged upon simply because the firm stepped on the wrong toes. But parochialism can be to your firm's advantage, so long as...</p>

                        <p>"Y-yeah. I totally understand what this page is saying."</p>

                        <p>"Explain it then!"</p>

                        <p>"What am I, a monkey? It's rude to ask your friends to show off like that."</p>

                        <p>"O-oh. You're right. Sorry..." Shiori casts her eyes downward.</p>

                        <p>"Don't sweat it," I say, though I'm the one sweating it. I don't know how much more I can stand the taste of my own foot in my mouth. Why, oh why, do I have to be such an incorrigible tryhard? </p>

                            <p>Honestly, walking back through the woods at night with kids isn't exactly safe in the first place, but I'm remembering Al wasn't ever someone you'd call 'prudent' when it came to childcare. With Monika being the way she is, Al was always the closest thing Shiori had to a real guardian. And when it came to the 'guard' part, he really wasn't much of one, because he seemed to think children are as invincible as they're energetic.</p>

        <p>I remember one time that Shiori convinced me that we should try to sail down one of the Rumeuri Hill creeks in a pool float, and Al just stroked his beard and said it was a 'mighty fine adventure for tiny sailors.' We ended up getting thrown into some bushes when the float popped against some banks. My mom was really furious, and I couldn't play with Shiori for a week. It might've been even longer if Al hadn't come to my house and apologized over and over.</p>

        It's already weird to anthropomorphize The Root like this. Not <em>unprecedented.</em> A big slice of the magi world is definitely Gnostic in its approach. So, The Root to them is more like an entity. And that entity is Sophia, the personification of wisdom, who's supposed to enlighten you and save you from the fake and horrific material world. But you're not literally supposed to go... um... goo goo gah gah for her." Shiori's eyes seem to lose concentration for a moment. Like she's pushing the limits of her ten year old brain. It doesn't help that the rustling's continued this whole time.</p>

<p>"People get up to all kinds of weird infatutions," I say. "If you've got this weird belief that everything you can touch sucks and is fake, and some beautiful lady is supposed to save you, then why wouldn't you fall in love with her?"</p>

<p>"So, you're saying Arcani sees himself as a fixer-upper?"</p>

<p>"I don't know what that phrase means, but somehow I know you're being tasteless." </p>

<p>We hit a lull in our thinking. And in the silence, the rustling a little unbearable. It reminds me of how I was when I was alone, constantly listening to the books swishing their secrets. Shiori's eye starts twitching.</p>

<p>"Let's find the next snitch," she says.</p>

<p>"...Yeah."</p>

<p>There's a desk stuffed into the top-right corner of the room, making me think that whoever does any work here likes to work in a cozy space. The rustling seems to get loudest near desk's pencil drawer. We pull the thin implement out, and among all the pens and stationary there's some filled-out order sheets for chemicals. For... diethyl ether.</p>

<p>"Ether?" Now I'm the one tilting my head.  "I don't even know what ether is used for."
</p>

<p>"I think I read a story once? They used the ether to ruin the guard dog's sense of smell," Shiori says to me.</p>

<p>At any rate, a few of the order sheets slowly twist themselves to life, and actually join <em>together</em> to become a single page. The text on the page scrambles around, letters reordering themselves into new positions. In fact, the characters literally twist upon themselves, letters becoming new letters.</p>

                Father has a lot of axioms. But mother pays the most attention to one. "Consumarre set Coniungi." To complete, is <em>to unite.</em> The exemplar of completion, of course, is consummation of marriage.

                <br><br>
                That much is not lost on me. I am the completion of both mother and father, and I'm proud of it. 

                <br><br>
                But it feels rather insidious to me, sometimes. I have a great nose like my mother. When I'm near people, like a scent, I can understand their potential, their <em>completed form.</em> Everything they could be. 
                <br><br>
                Or everything they could be a part of.

                </div>
                Sometimes I wonder how many go through the world completely unaware of the hint of mythic blood in them. I'm half dryad, so my lineage is apparent to me. But so many of our new citizens who come in, many of them are not even magi. 

                <br><br>
                They come less in search of Sophia, and more for a new start. We promise them things. Sometimes we offer them things. I'm afraid that, perhaps behind my back, my mother and father threaten them with things. 
                <br><br>
                But I'm too small of a person to protect every single person who comes here. If I can protect anyone, it would be the children. 
        </div>

<p>        Isn't this just a bit too coincidental?</p>

<p>        We know exactly one lady who's got a great sense of smell, and she also happens to love children. Also, 'Belladonna?' As in 'Beautiful Woman?' Wow. Just... wow. </p>

<p>
                "Isn't this just Hannah?" I ask. Might as well say the quiet part out loud.
        
</p>
<p>        Shiori starts biting her fingernail in response. I feel sort of sorry for being so blunt about it, because the implication seems to stress her out. "It makes some sense.... but not quite? I don't sense any actual mana from anyone around here. I mean, it's possible to suppress it, but something just doesn't feel right. For one thing, reading these two snitches one after the other, I feel like Belladonna must be Arcani's daughter. But Arcani must be long dead. So, at best, Hannah must be some kind of descendant. But besides that... Hannah has a terrible sense of smell."</p>

<p>
                "Huh? She was literally just <em>sniffing</em> us," I say.
        
</p>
<p>
                "Yeah, I know. I know! But that's just a thing she does! It's figurative! I know for a fact she's got an awful sense of smell. There was a time she was hospitalized because she mixed up some cleaning stuff wrong and couldn't smell it." Shiori's absolutely adamant.
        
</p>                        

<p>
                "That's right," a new voice pops in. "Nothing's as simple as it seems around here."
        
</p>
<p>
                Once again, Alexa's suddenly there, right between us. 
        
</p>

<p>                        "If I've ever done that, I don't remember it," I say completely truthfully. "So, what? Are you gonna let the plot slip or what?"</p>

                        <p>"I'd say you're doing a fine job figuring it out yourself. It's not gonna help anybody to just spoil everything, is it?" Alexa hops up on the desk we were rifling through and crosses her legs. Though, in doing so, she accidentally knocks a bunch of crap to the floor, including loose paper, some pens, paperweights, and even The Codex which just seems ruffle up in umbrage. "...sorry. I'll say this much. You're not wrong in how you're thinking. But you're not right, either."</p>

<p>
                                "Oh! That's basically a Barnum statement but for plot!" Shiori bubbles, making Alexa frown. 
        
</p>                        
<p>
                                Well. She's not <em>wrong.</em>
        
</p>




<p>"Isn't it kinda weird, though?" Shiori's at full concentration, the most 'magi' I've seen her since we got to The Heart. "The way Arcani talks about Sophia -- isn't it kinda simpy?" </p>
                        
<p>"It's what now?"</p>

<p>"Er, it's almost like he has a schoolboy <em>crush</em> on Sophia... Which... " she trails off.</P>
        
<p>"Is that weird?" I ask. But it doesn't even seem to register with her, so I'm basically asking the empty air. "Shiori? Is that weird?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely," a voice says, from seemingly nowhere. And once again, there's Alexa right between us. Though I'm the only one startled.</p>
</p>

<p>"Where'd you even go last time?" I ask.</p>



<p>Okay, so what are you doing here? Come to let the plot slip?" </p>

<p>"I'd say you two have a handle where the story's headed already. It's not gonna help anybody to just spoil everything, is it?" Alexa sits
