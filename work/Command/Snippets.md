What happens when something important cracks? 

What's a child try to do? They rush to find something to glue it back together. They'll tape it up from the inside so nobody notices. They'll hurt themselves with the super glue and tear their skin off. 

They'll probably drop it once or twice and break it even more. 

Adults have the emotional adaptability to put themselves back together in ways that children don't.

Sometimes the first truly adult emotion someone learns is hate.
