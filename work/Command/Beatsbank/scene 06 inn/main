"You know, at some point... you have to learn that people die," Shiori said quietly. "Everyone knows people die. But no one knows it from the start." //!!

So it's like when a KFC and a Taco Bell use the same building! Shiori said. Kyrie facepalms. //!!

Those aren't angels, those are sirens... //!!

Wait. That doesn't make sense. Hands aren't part of the face. Ugh! I hate readers like you! Stop it! You're the worst!//!!

Look, it's a list of names... Jeanne Mills? Um. You know. She escaped from the People's Temple. Jim Jones? Guyana? Koolaid? All that jazz. Well some people think it was a CIA thing, yeah... //!!

Haven't you seen the brain proportioned homunculus? It's got huuuuge hands. "I have no idea what you're talking about," I said, slightly miffed that Shiori always talked like I had the last fifteen years to read like she did.//!!

You can feel petals, or you can feel thorns, Kyrie said. It's up to you. //!!

The light chases after the dark, Clarie said plaintively. What? that doesnt make sense, Shiori said. Lights the fastest thing! Hush, shiori, mekuru said, miffed. No! Then Kyrie says actually I thought the same thing. Alexa also thinks the same lol.//!!

A fugue is an escape. One voice flees, the other chases, a question and an answer...Clarie said//!!

Clarie hears her own scathing voice from back when she was heiress. I don't... like the sound of my own voice.//!!

like a fugueitive!//!!
