"...And she just happened to also be part of a cult." "No, no, it's more like all the cults are kinda connected. Especially those Gnostic ones like the Freemasons and the Netabares, you know. Like, I've got this cousin thrice removed who's part of The El Los IIlluminados in LA. They're super scary. Oh! OH! This one time, they got these two guys from Brazil and just locked them up in these masks and -" //!!

Do you know the etymology of autopsy? It's auto and opsis. To see with own's one eyes. this is when mekuru actually examines the bodies. as a form of escalation in part vii maybe. //!!

"Say it in red, then,' I spit out. "Mekuru and Alexa share their existence." (Mekuru is shook) //!!

No! Yorick's a good boy! //!!

What makes more sense to you? Someone who wasn't there made a ritual that nobody knows about, or that one extremely powerful and spiteful little girl's powers flew off the handle? //!!

So the secret potion is... distilled water. "Well, when you think about it, if you had to drug someone without them knowing, it should probably be tasteless like water." //!!

I love you, mekuru!' Shiori chirped (in caesar cipher, but mekuru hyperfocusing doesn't notice. You too Yorick! Y belu oek Cuakhk! Oek jee Oehysa! //!!   

mekuru stutters saying someone just made themselves look like nick when forced to try and explain the corpse reanimation //!!

it's okay shiori, tell the truth. i won't be mad no matter what it is. the more info i get, the more i'm sure i can prove shiori's innocence. shiori 3: today i reanimated nick's corpse  "... Okay, I'm a little freaking mad. " Y-you said you wouldn't be mad! "I'm not mad," I lie. //!!

It's like online homework programs that only accept really specific answers. This is foreshadowed with the 'everyone but shiori and mekuru is a magi' answer. Then finally it's used for the ALEXA PAGE answer. //!!

Fakeout, where Alexa tries to convince Mekuru that she's her 'other self' //!!

Fake out that Girl X died //!!

What about my mom? //!!

praise the lord. exalt his name solo leveling //!!

Both Alexa and Arcani have gray eyes, or gunslinger eyes. Pow pow! Shiori makes a joke.//!!

is there a real separateness of person and disease? mekuru on alexa//!!

creaking gate always hangs the longest, alexa says about alphonse//!!

Wild laughter and Alexa giggles. Are Kusa is wild grass, wwwwwwww.//!!

The kind of pattern you might see rendered in cheap linoleum, referring to Masonic Mosaic, but here it's rendered in marble//!!

So like cotton eyed joe? Shiori asks, alexa can't help but keep snickering. //!!

Shadows are bound to earth. They can't leave Earth.//!!

You have an imaginary friend you can hear? No! I can just... feel his emotions.
so you're saying she felt compelled to retie the umbilican cord, i'm spitting acid again.//!!

you know, shiori said with dawning realization, at moment slike this you guys really are similar!//!!

Don't say another goddamned word. //!!

It was uncharacteristically stupid, Mekuru said sharply.//!!

She became the path//!!

Alexa was... afraid to go down into the dark.//!!

Maybe the town floods, Mekuru nearly drowns, but Alexa saves her. "I thought I told you to leave!"//!!

"Go," Lessia said. "Kids should play."//!!

Alexa takes on swagger like Jim Jagger, a lawyer throwing words and words to see what sticks, almost folksy. She has a chameleon demeanor.//!!

The final recipe is just Nick's favorite meal. Made with love! A meal for an aching heart. //!!

Isn't she just clearly in denial? She barely believes herself. She looks like she's being polygraphtested.//!!

People... you have to listen to what they say, Kyrie said. They're not just bundles of emotions. They believe things. Sometimes crazy things. Sometimes very desperately. Thoughts are real things. I've learned that in all my years as a psycholgoist.  I thought that if I just came in and sat and empathized with them, and felt their 'true' feelings, that I could coax them through solidarity. And... it works sometimes. But it can be so destructive. You know.  I could empathize with someone perfectly. 100percent. let's say I believe that. I feel every single emotion they've got. But you know what I'm basically saying<? That I don't have to listen. That I'm going to enter this interaction, and I'll be the changer, and they're gonna be the changed. The things peopel believe... the things peopel think aren't just pretty decorations on top of their feelings.  //!!

Clarie was quiet. Sometimes words aren't enough. I don't get people. Honestly. Don't get Alexa. Why she likks being mean sometimes. Why Hana' s so desperate. Even though I can ... hear the rumblings. The thought machinery. Alexa'll say  "mean thing here!" Hana'll say "Dajiefw!" I can imitate it before they even say it. But I still don't get it. All I can do is keep thinking about it. And hope that one day thoughts become feelings.  //!!

Clarie's startlingly good impressions were so bizarre. A lachrymose tone shifted without warning to a breathy one. Then suddenly like pin pricks. She could've been an actress.

Clarie could've been an actress if she cared enough Nick said. Not if she doesn't learn to move her face. alphonse said.   //!!

Alphonse has a soft spot for them. You can't call the way he loves Hana a soft spot.. she's just his daughter. For them... they're like kittens.  //!!

And- "Hates Nick. Even I can feel it." 

time flies like an arrow, and fruit flies like a banana! "tempus fuckit,' shiori nodded sagely. //!!

Haha is a pun, for haha as in mother. Alexa makes this pun

magi are... very zero sum creatures, shiori said sadly. for all their brilliance, any resource, they can only really imagine stealing it... truth can only be reached by consuming the ignorant..   //!!

shiori sudders as alexa plays her gambit. coniunctio as in.. the merging of conscious and unconscious. "that's right mekuru. i'm your unconscious trying to merge back with you.." //!!

Perhaps hanari dresses a bit more licentiously, leading Shiori to bluntly call her a nut gobbler. "Shiori I am begging you to learn how to self filter..." 

I am self filtering, though? //!!


White coral islands in a dark blue sea: The seeming of distinctness, the seeming of individuality --but all are only projections from the same sea bottom.Promontory //!!

mekuru learns the trick that she can keep bugging Alexa to say a red truth and if she doesn't it probably means something. at some point alexa should use this against her. probably with the shared existence one //!!

this statue is... aristophanes' archaic being.  //!!

"say you won't participate in this stupid game.' alexa becomes actually quite vicious with prima. this is confusing to everyone else who do not know why. for some reason muto, her husban sits by and watches with his arms crossed. he does nto seem like the type of man tot ake that sort of thing lying down. he doens't respond though. later:"i'm a man who listens to his gut. sometimes... you know... that you deserve something." //!!

When Alexa becomes pregnant, her personality subtly shifts. She "mellows out" according to everyone else. In fact, Alexa cries multiple times during her pregnancy, showing more emotion than anyone had ever seen of her. ("Even my mother has hormones," Mekuru says coldly) //!!

Lessie's such a weird name don't you think? It's like Lassie!  //!!

muto, what comeuppance could you possibly deserve and why? //!!

We know there's a cult! We know you eat the evil apples!//!!

She's shaken to her core, when she stares up through the skylight to see the light from the Fresnel lens. Her broken spirit tries to piece something together. Something between a plan for salvation and a plan for revenge. //!!

and don't calling me lessie. don't act familiar with me. alexa literally only does this with muto and prima. i've cleared out the bushes lessie, the gardener said. oh, thank you,//!!

“Look what you made me do,” Shelly said.
A beat later, as the blood dripped from her daughter’s body,
Shelly suddenly changed her tone.
Strange words came out of her mouth, like some foreign
language.
