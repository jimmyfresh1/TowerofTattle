Wait you're saying that I'm... From... In... vitro... fertilization? Are you... What?! HUH?! "Umm... Consummare Est Coniungi?" "Quiet Shiori!" //!!

oh. don't worry. i always expected that i was adopted. my mom and i don't even have the same color hair. it's obvious, really. 
 er um... it's not quite that!  //!!


A grand trick. A prank. If a witch explodes someone's heart it's not much of a prank. If it's small bombs... well, I'm not saying it's FUNNY.   //!!

"Oh poor me," Alexa muttered, put off by the self pity. //!!

i notice that one of the cadaver bags has a hole poked in it.  //!!

all mekuru remembers at first. "you put something to make her sleep hard, didn't you?" "i'm not gonna drink it." muto has a grave look on his face. //!!

She thinks her daddy is a prince! Shiori blurted out. //!!

There's a point of creation... where one being becomes two. So if you want to reverse the process then... two becomes one. //!!

"well, in timaeus the demiurge is a reasonably good figure... he grants a soul to the body" //!!

Hide book behind her back //!!

now don't mess with me, Shiori //!!

ontogeny recapitulates cosmogeny //!!

chiraoscuro churrasco? shiori asked, her stomach growling //!!

"Shiori, did ya' know I escaped from Guantanimo Bay?" 

"Really?!"

"Hey, we can see a little slip of the marina from here. There's fishing boats moving out there!" Shiori gasped. "This place is alive."


Shiori and Mekuru eating candy cutely while Nick scratches his head. //!! 

Nick looked a little uncomfortable. This isn't a topic for kids. But somehow it seems we can bully him into talking with his NPC behavior. His eyes glaze over a bit, and he sounds a bit like a recording, feeling suddenly very mannequinish. I guess they really are pliable after all. //!! 

"We're doing a perpetual stew! I've got chocolate." "You know what? Keep to your side of the stew." a memory mekuru has. that corresponds to her taste being enhanced. //!! 

the light hearted ness of the perpetual stew contrasts with the awful dish. //!! 

The first Consumere Est Coniungi beat is at Hana's place. This one emphasizes copulation, coitus. Hana's thirstiness can be an aid here. This can also be the first hint of the town's bizarre makeup. Infact. We can reveal that very early on using Belladonna's Journal. I think it's highly appropriate. Introducing the idea of lineage and genetics. //!! 

The second consumere est coniungi is during nick's scene somewhere. another statue or something is observed. here, consumere as eating is emphasized.//!! 

"The maddest she got was the time we tried to cook a perpetual stew..." "Hey! Stop adding the maple syrup! Now we're gonna have to add like eight spoons of salt!" "We could open a restaurant here!" "No. No way. This place doesn't have the economy for it. We'd have to move to the big city and do it." Alexa hopping mad. Forces them to eat it.//!! 

Mental disease like Hinamazawa Syndrome runs through the area. Maybe it's the mist that's always floating on through. I don't know. I really hope... you kids can just get out of here. People go nuts around here. We've got a lot of nutjobs. That's why Kyrie's made it her mission to raise this place out of superstition, to help people with their mental illness. I'd say it's valiant but futile. Lately more and more people are showing symptoms. //!! 

There's... some kind of disease that runs through these parts. My mother... decided to ... end her life at one point. "I'm so sorry..." "No," Nick scratched his cheek. "It's not a fun story, but life goes on. You have to keep going. You just have to. But... it's not a story for kids to hear. I never wanted you guys to hear it. Clarie and Kyrie's father..." "And Hana's mother...?" "No, we... we don't know what happened to her. She disappeared one day. I guess we're all... hoping she just up and left. Hana's never been able to deal with it since. Al took her in as if she was his daughter."//!! 

Rotting flowers. Rotting roses. Softly rotting. Quietly rotting. This is nick's perception of hanari after the tragic incident. //!! 

Mekuru sees a vision of a young girl being forced to eat a dish while crying. An unseen figure is glowering over her//!! 

You know my mom had a secret recipe book... She... well. She burned it, and ... let's just say she intentionally isn't here with us anymore. //!! 

Schmutzdecke.//!! 

Shiori: I wanna churn butter! he seems happier with the conversation topic change.//!! 

yandere hana to nick. hmm. you havent been having a ltitel amouerrte have you? almost like she's sniffing nick. an AMOURETTE is a trifling or ephemeral love affair!//!! 

mekuru early on mentions it feels like something should be in her pocket... 'why do i keep having the premonition that something should be there?'//!! 

She would say things like ‘Oh, are wehaving a nice day?’ but it didn’t sound like she cared—it wassarcastic and derisive.” But then she mellowed out. "//!! 

Hana talked about running away sometimes with Nick. but why? from what? nick isn't sure logically, but emotionally he gets it. //!! 

the statues are all over. nick's is also at the water treatment. what a  strangely out of place statue!//!! 


nick spotted nearby where alphonse takes his life. //!!

This kind of thing is well documented actually. It's like different hands in mahjong. They all win, but some give you more points.//!!

There's something in the water! You're all drinking water bottles. I suppose you're gonna say that there's a huge conspiracy going on with Aquifina?//!!

shiori has a very public display of magic power, which makes everyone incredibly suspicious. it's after kyrie and clarie's death//!!

You're a disgusting person,' I'd said to my mom. I still remember how the words tasted coming off my mouth. //!!

Some people try to worship Shiori//!!)

Say that you won't participate in this stupid game.//!!

i've seen her. (the woman in the fog) kiri. kira kiri. //!!

ah. i get it. it's the reasonable ones who are the most disgusting. when i thought of witch hunts, i thought of belligerent screaming people. but now i realize the worst ones act like they're concerned. everything sounds nice until you realize they think their mild manners justifies executing a young girl to save their skin. i hate their quietly demurring voices//!!

crazy cultist tries to kill shiori, and her powers flare up and hurt him//!!

you're telling me you went around chirping 'creatio ex nihilo' and 'reductio ad nihilum?!' I wanted to strangle my client//!!

are you telling me you woke up this morning and decided to wear a gorget? "are you telling me you didn't wear yours today?'//!!

somethihng appears blocking his knife. a little shield in his breast pocket with a werid little teddy bear. a loud clang is heard. ... reductio... ad... nihilum' someone muttered and creatio ex nihilo//!!

muto lies and declares that it was in hi spocket the whole time. //!!

Muto at one point has to stop someone who's physically threatening shiori. He sighs with relief. The tension all leaves his body. Sits down, puts his hand to his forehead. You wanna know something shiori, he says with a derisive smile. The gun's fake. //!!

at some point people gather around shiori trying to worship her//!!


//scenebits Nick, having a pretty good read on people: "Was she really doing her best for me? Can't say I think so. Still, I always got the sense I was one of the few people she could stand. Your mom's got her reasons. "To have you killed?" Nick gave a long a hard look like he'd eaten something sour. "This town's... different Mekuru. I don't expect you to get it. A kid shouldn't have to."


"You know, at some point... you have to learn that people die," Shiori said quietly. "Everyone knows people die. But no one knows it from the start." //!!

So it's like when a KFC and a Taco Bell use the same building! Shiori said. Kyrie facepalms. //!!

Those aren't angels, those are sirens... //!!

Wait. That doesn't make sense. Hands aren't part of the face. Ugh! I hate readers like you! Stop it! You're the worst!//!!

Look, it's a list of names... Jeanne Mills? Um. You know. She escaped from the People's Temple. Jim Jones? Guyana? Koolaid? All that jazz. Well some people think it was a CIA thing, yeah... //!!

Haven't you seen the brain proportioned homunculus? It's got huuuuge hands. "I have no idea what you're talking about," I said, slightly miffed that Shiori always talked like I had the last fifteen years to read like she did.//!!

You can feel petals, or you can feel thorns, Kyrie said. It's up to you. //!!

The light chases after the dark, Clarie said plaintively. What? that doesnt make sense, Shiori said. Lights the fastest thing! Hush, shiori, mekuru said, miffed. No! Then Kyrie says actually I thought the same thing. Alexa also thinks the same lol.//!!

A fugue is an escape. One voice flees, the other chases, a question and an answer...Clarie said//!!

Clarie hears her own scathing voice from back when she was heiress. I don't... like the sound of my own voice.//!!

like a fugueitive!//!!


Clarie: "You're young. Your life's ahead of you, should be able to move on from tragedy. Hope springs eternal. //!!

Mekuru muses if I could leave without my name I would. Shiori says no! Names are super important! They show what... what they meant for you. Clarie's is light... meaning she's //!!

Try to ride down stream in a raft. 'Not scared of water back then." Patricia, hill, bike. Big bowl of cereal the whole box, filled with milk. Bowl intended for big batch of leftovers, not one bowl of cereal. //!!

a beat of shiori avoiding eye contact noticeably, or multiple beats //!!


So Sussurokawa Cove would've been like... a hunting ground for the Netabare family? I mean, it makes sense. It's secluded, superstitious, easy to kidnap people from presumably... //!!

The statue that analogizes Nick and Hanari. Instead of offering a grape, Nick is just biting Hanari's Neck, while Hanari is slitting Nick's wrist and smelling the blood boquet. //!!

"Ooops! So clumsy!" Alexa, getting a papercut from the Codex Sussurokawa. Acts like an airheaded assistant. //!!

A telltail snitch keeps pointing to its eyes because it wants to see something good. Remember, telltail snitches are like origami birds. //!!

Yes, your eyes... Theyre like black holes. Empty. Taking in everything. Light won't ever escape them. //!!

It's kinda simpy... Sophia, the love of Arcani's life. //!!


A hunting ground... no... It... no way. It's not a hunting ground... It was a farm. //!!

Shiori starts babbling then burbling as she starts getting scared as she starts realizing what she's talking about//!!

A telltail snitch and vannaknoe are picking at each other. "Shouldn't they be friends?" "Yeah... frenemies, more like. They both think the other is really shameless." Immediately followed by journal beat of Shiori and Mekuru being shameless and acting like a vannaknoe and telltail snitch respectively. //!!


Nick you ugly bastard! Stop stringing her along!//!! 

"Mm. Not great. Al's got an eye for great art, but no heart to say she's no Picasso. Nick too cowardly to mention her complete lack of taste. Kyrie won't say it gives her the heeby jeebies." "And you?" "Don't like to hear cutting words. Won't say them." "Mom's honest, though." "Your mother is often mean. White noise." "No. It's a common misconception. He's not screaming himself. He hears it. Screaming." "...who? Who's... screaming?" "...nature. Nature's infinite scream." "Actually, based on the sky's strange color and the time of the pi" "Some hackfrauds think the scream is Krakatoa exploding. Silly. Needlessly impoverishes the piece. No imagination." Shiori falls silent and simply puffs up her cheeks while squeezing Yorick to her chest. //!! 

"...sorry. Said too much. Sometimes my tongue's still sharp." "Oh, Shiori always pouts." "No, you. Said too much about your mother." "I don't care. Say what you want about her." "No. You looked sad."//!! 

Clarie sings, and Mekuru and Shiori are transfixed.//!! 

Jeeze, look what my mom's wearing. Remember those stupid outfits she had us wear? "Uhh... Are we doing something useful right now?" "She's looking for us. I guess because we were originally at the party?"//!! 


They're spying from the veranda. The party is in the botanical garden. Those are toy binoculars. There was nothing else!//!! 

I can't believe you're actually making cider from that orchard. You've always been such a pain about it just because you hate apples! //!! ))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))

Mekuru we don't have time for this! We have to recover your 'self'! Everything else is just a sideshow! Shiori snapped. Or at least as much as Shiori could snap. "You're... You're right. I'm getting caught up."//!! 

Belladonna? Wow. Just wow.//!! 

For some reason, everyone has a really strong scent now...//!! 

We're closer to their core. Who they are. Sometimes you feel something more than your own name. //!! 

Mekuru can't help herself and she turns her ears on more powerfully. Clarie kindly shuts her ears. 'It's ok. you don't have to.'//!! 


Shiori sees Hanari in breeches. "She's a horsegirl," Shiori whispered//!! 

Shiori makes inappropriate baby factory joke? Honestly, yes, probably at some point it's gotta happen//!! 

Hana has vague memories of her father leaving when she was young.	//!! 

Hana is a Judas lamb so she is also our best insight to how the children were like. Talks about children and their dreams and so forth. she keeps talking about children and children's dreams in a bit of a new agey way.//!! 

nick and hannah are will they won't they. shiori: i always thought they were dating! mekuru: huh? definitely not. they're not dating. nick: it's... complicated. //!! 


GIRL X'S DIARY ACQUIRED.
For a moment I can't see.
Then it's like a blindfold is taken off my face.
The sun glares, and the figure's back is turned. The voice sounds familiar, but unfamiliarly cruel, so I can't quite place it.
Oho. You're a hateful little thing aren't you?
But you hide it. Not like those sisters. They can only hide the surface.
You're not afraid of the light are you?
No matter any shadow it casts?

Um. Why are we hiding from your mom?
Because we didn't dress up for the party.
Ok? She's an NPC.
Then you go up to her. Go on.
Er, I don't feel like it!" Shiori said rubbing her ears.
Still, I just don't feel like we're doing anything useful...
Ugh. My mom got stupidly dressed for this. She put on some really tacky red lipstick... "She's looking for us. Remember those stupid outfits she used to make us wear? I guess because we were originally at the party?"
Mekuru, this is a waste of time. You're using toy binoculars!
They were the only ones I could find!
We don't have time for this! Shiori stamped her foot. "We have to recover your 'self'! Everything else is just a sideshow! Shiori snapped. Or at least as much as Shiori could snap. "You're... You're right. I'm getting caught up."
N...no... you're right. I'm paying attention to stupid stuff. But I just... This can be useful. Alexa said we have to solve the murders, right?
...something like that, yes, Shiori said doubtfully. But looking at them isn't going to matter if we can't even hear them.
I can almost.
All the way from here?
Yeah... just almost.
Hi.
Eeek! Shiori and I jump in unison.
Clarie pops up.
Cl...Clarie?
I always remembered her as someone like Boo Radley. I guess when this party was going on, she was hanging out in the actual house?
Why aren't you with adults? Hookie? Fight with mom?
Er... There's pretty much no way to explain, 'we're trying to solve a murder, and a few days from now you're one of the victims!'
We're shy and want to know more about Hanari.
Why not ask?
We're nosy kids. Can't ask some things of a lady. Or they'll hit you.
Hana doesn't hit. She's kind. And gentle.
No, no! She totally does! Totally!
Must have said something insensitive like you always do. Shiori lines.
I just said she had a pretty name! Because she's pretty just like a flower!
And then?
And that Hannah was the name of a Biblical lady who really wanted Biblical kids. And that Hana's baby clock is ticking and she sniffed out Nick as the only good match for miles, so it was like, you know, romantic!
I wanted to hit her for that one.
Uhuh. Story checks out. Good karate chop on head for that one, deserved.
It still hurt though...
You're eavesdropping?
Trying to...
Calm down. Breathe in. Stop trying to shut out the ambient noise.

Scene describing Mekuru's hearing improving, whispers in the air, making her shudder.


And then...
I can't believe you're actually making cider from that orchard. You've always been such a pain about it just because you hate apples!
And...

Nick you ugly bastard! Stop stringing her along.



Scene of Nick and Arcani squabbling.

Hana's sniffing out his wallet... Shiori gaped.
Ahhh... Hana, if only you were my actual daughter!


I'm telling you. There were children. They all disappeared. They would've been your age by now, he growled. 
Ok pops, what about us? They must have thought you were ugly like sin.

Hana should just find someone else from outside the town, I said, my brain trying to forget that was a totally meaningless prospect.
Soft spot for Nick. Manages the Crecer farm. Hana hates the smell of blood. She can't stand it.
And how's Nick feel?
Not repulsed. But a little weirded out. When we were toddlers, she babysat us pretty sure. Can't remember too well.
Are you serious? She's a dinosaur.
Clarie frowns. "She was only a teenager. Not that bad age difference."
A teenaged dinosaur.
If you want to know more about her, come with.

You learn a lot looking at someone's art.
The two of us were transfixed. We'd never seen anything like it. It was...
Awful.
Mm. Not great. Al's got an eye for great art, but no heart to say she's no Picasso. Nick too cowardly to mention her complete lack of taste. Kyrie won't say it gives her the heeby jeebies.
And you? "Don't like to hear cutting words. Won't say them."
Mom's honest, though. "Your mother is often mean. White noise."
She's right, but somehow I don't like how bluntly she said it.
It looks like The Scream... oh my god, is that Nick?
I... actually am not sure.
Look, he's screaming, just like the Munch painting!
No. In the Munch Painting, it's a common misconception. He's not screaming himself. He hears it. Screaming.
...who? Who's... screaming? "...nature. Nature's infinite scream."
Actually, based on the sky's strange color and the time of the piec-
Some hackfrauds think the scream is Krakatoa exploding. Silly. Needlessly impoverishes the piece. No imagination. Shiori falls silent and simply puffs up her cheeks while squeezing Yorick to her chest.
...sorry. Said too much. Sometimes my tongue's still sharp. "Oh, Shiori always pouts."
No, you. Said too much about your mother. "I don't care. Say what you want about her."
No. You looked sad.
Mekuru relates to the Infinite Scream. Even right now, she feels like...
Hana is an ok singer though. Liked to sing a lullaby from her mother.
Clarie sings, and Mekuru and Shiori are transfixed.
I should... go. Be good.
They go back to party.
I'm telling you. There were children. They all disappeared. They would've been your age by now, he growled.
Ok pops, what about us?
They must have thought you were ugly like sin.
Nature's infinite scream, huh?
Absentmindedly, pull out the book, trying to think. Singing the lullaby.
Then the telltail snitch starts making its nest. Huh?
Unlock a bunch of journals.
Belladonna? Wow. Just wow.
Alexa pops out of nowhere.
Ahhh! Where do you even come from?! Where were you?
I got lost, she said sadly.
I suppose you're wanting to see the next murder, hm?
Well, not exactly wanting.

- Why, you two are smelling wonderful today!
- Shiori is having a moment. Two faces at once. The shy smile of a young girl and a doting aunt. Something unspeakably sad about it.
- NPC behavior?

The party is in the botanical garden

That's rather suspicious isn't it?
Of course... of course I know she's probably...
...intimately related to everything here. I just don't know how.
- I look into the bathroom mirror and realize I can't even clearly see my own face.
Where my journal should be is a book titled the Historia Sussurokawa.

Um I think I'm part Italian. I'm not sure

Shiori starts tapping her foot impatiently. It strikes me as odd, just how blindsided she is by this new area.

How do we know where we're supposed to go?
The Codex Sussurokawa will guide you. To new locations. To different times. Getting to the heart of the mystery is to get through The Heart of this tower.
But before they travel they hear a voice

It's empty?
Oh! It's a tell tail snitch! What does it want?

Mekuru's first journal entry. Play for laughs?

It wants a doll of a prince.

Today I met...
Today I asked mommy why our house was so much bigger than everyone else's. Is it that she married a prince? Did my daddy have to go back to his kingdo-
I shut the book immediately.


Think of me like an assistant tied to this Vault.
Like... an AI? Like the other Alexa?
Whatever helps you understand, though she didn't quite look like she got it. To be honest, I didn't either.
Your eyes... They're the same color as...
Shiori looks over at me.

Yes, it's quite the cute thing isn't it? Alexa introduction.





GIRL X'S DIARY ACQUIRED.
For a moment I can't see.
Then it's like a blindfold is taken off my face.
The sun glares, and the figure's back is turned. The voice sounds familiar, but unfamiliarly cruel, so I can't quite place it.
Oho. You're a hateful little thing aren't you?
But you hide it. Not like those sisters. They can only hide the surface.
You're not afraid of the light are you?
No matter any shadow it casts?

Shiori looks at me with a bit of an astounded face.
Do you... um, read a lot of detective books? You seem pretty...
Why am I unaffected, indeed? Did I have antipathy for him?
Of course a corpse is disgusting. The sight of it makes me want to throw up. But my emotions...
I don't want her to know I'm a freak whose emotions are dying.
I can't... remember. Him. What he was like. I don 't even know what we're supposed to be looking for.'
I can help with that.'
Ah! God, you really need to stop doing that!
The night seems to pass into dawn, and faintly I can see the sun rising in the west.
There's a lot vannaknoes here...
Seems like they're attracted to the dark, decrepit, and unseemly.
Telltail snitches like their sunshine.

alchemy symbol gold, sun, silver, moon
everyone understands muto as quite brave, but he sees himself as a coward

Everything seems to point to Kyrie at first. Mekuru somewhat callousedly reasons that it's her. Shiori denies it vehemently down to her soul. But they find out about Kurakira. Shiori is crushed. But she works to exonerate Kyrie. And accidentally (incorrectly) implicates herself. 

Maybe Arcani and Alexa also have views into people's dreams

to board the ferry, they have to give certain details of the murders?
Kyrie forces Alexa to go to therapy with her and Mekuru, which makes Alexa chafe. Alexa finds it hilarious and ironic and is in complete contempt of her

shiori: but...but...! how were you googling things!!!

"...And she just happened to also be part of a cult." "No, no, it's more like all the cults are kinda connected. Especially those Gnostic ones like the Freemasons and the Netabares, you know. Like, I've got this cousin thrice removed who's part of The El Los IIlluminados in LA. They're super scary. Oh! OH! This one time, they got these two guys from Brazil and just locked them up in these masks and -" //!!

Do you know the etymology of autopsy? It's auto and opsis. To see with own's one eyes. this is when mekuru actually examines the bodies. as a form of escalation in part vii maybe. //!!

"Say it in red, then,' I spit out. "Mekuru and Alexa share their existence." (Mekuru is shook) //!!

No! Yorick's a good boy! //!!

What makes more sense to you? Someone who wasn't there made a ritual that nobody knows about, or that one extremely powerful and spiteful little girl's powers flew off the handle? //!!

So the secret potion is... distilled water. "Well, when you think about it, if you had to drug someone without them knowing, it should probably be tasteless like water." //!!

I love you, mekuru!' Shiori chirped (in caesar cipher, but mekuru hyperfocusing doesn't notice. You too Yorick! Y belu oek Cuakhk! Oek jee Oehysa! //!!   

mekuru stutters saying someone just made themselves look like nick when forced to try and explain the corpse reanimation //!!

it's okay shiori, tell the truth. i won't be mad no matter what it is. the more info i get, the more i'm sure i can prove shiori's innocence. shiori 3: today i reanimated nick's corpse  "... Okay, I'm a little freaking mad. " Y-you said you wouldn't be mad! "I'm not mad," I lie. //!!

It's like online homework programs that only accept really specific answers. This is foreshadowed with the 'everyone but shiori and mekuru is a magi' answer. Then finally it's used for the ALEXA PAGE answer. //!!

Fakeout, where Alexa tries to convince Mekuru that she's her 'other self' //!!

Fake out that Girl X died //!!

What about my mom? //!!

praise the lord. exalt his name solo leveling //!!

Both Alexa and Arcani have gray eyes, or gunslinger eyes. Pow pow! Shiori makes a joke.//!!

is there a real separateness of person and disease? mekuru on alexa//!!

creaking gate always hangs the longest, alexa says about alphonse//!!

Wild laughter and Alexa giggles. Are Kusa is wild grass, wwwwwwww.//!!

The kind of pattern you might see rendered in cheap linoleum, referring to Masonic Mosaic, but here it's rendered in marble//!!

So like cotton eyed joe? Shiori asks, alexa can't help but keep snickering. //!!

Shadows are bound to earth. They can't leave Earth.//!!

You have an imaginary friend you can hear? No! I can just... feel his emotions.
so you're saying she felt compelled to retie the umbilican cord, i'm spitting acid again.//!!

you know, shiori said with dawning realization, at moment slike this you guys really are similar!//!!

Don't say another goddamned word. //!!

It was uncharacteristically stupid, Mekuru said sharply.//!!

She became the path//!!

Alexa was... afraid to go down into the dark.//!!

Maybe the town floods, Mekuru nearly drowns, but Alexa saves her. "I thought I told you to leave!"//!!

"Go," Lessia said. "Kids should play."//!!

Alexa takes on swagger like Jim Jagger, a lawyer throwing words and words to see what sticks, almost folksy. She has a chameleon demeanor.//!!

The final recipe is just Nick's favorite meal. Made with love! A meal for an aching heart. //!!

Isn't she just clearly in denial? She barely believes herself. She looks like she's being polygraphtested.//!!

People... you have to listen to what they say, Kyrie said. They're not just bundles of emotions. They believe things. Sometimes crazy things. Sometimes very desperately. Thoughts are real things. I've learned that in all my years as a psycholgoist.  I thought that if I just came in and sat and empathized with them, and felt their 'true' feelings, that I could coax them through solidarity. And... it works sometimes. But it can be so destructive. You know.  I could empathize with someone perfectly. 100percent. let's say I believe that. I feel every single emotion they've got. But you know what I'm basically saying<? That I don't have to listen. That I'm going to enter this interaction, and I'll be the changer, and they're gonna be the changed. The things peopel believe... the things peopel think aren't just pretty decorations on top of their feelings.  //!!

Clarie was quiet. Sometimes words aren't enough. I don't get people. Honestly. Don't get Alexa. Why she likks being mean sometimes. Why Hana' s so desperate. Even though I can ... hear the rumblings. The thought machinery. Alexa'll say  "mean thing here!" Hana'll say "Dajiefw!" I can imitate it before they even say it. But I still don't get it. All I can do is keep thinking about it. And hope that one day thoughts become feelings.  //!!

Clarie's startlingly good impressions were so bizarre. A lachrymose tone shifted without warning to a breathy one. Then suddenly like pin pricks. She could've been an actress.

Clarie could've been an actress if she cared enough Nick said. Not if she doesn't learn to move her face. alphonse said.   //!!

Alphonse has a soft spot for them. You can't call the way he loves Hana a soft spot.. she's just his daughter. For them... they're like kittens.  //!!

And- "Hates Nick. Even I can feel it." 

time flies like an arrow, and fruit flies like a banana! "tempus fuckit,' shiori nodded sagely. //!!

Haha is a pun, for haha as in mother. Alexa makes this pun

magi are... very zero sum creatures, shiori said sadly. for all their brilliance, any resource, they can only really imagine stealing it... truth can only be reached by consuming the ignorant..   //!!

shiori sudders as alexa plays her gambit. coniunctio as in.. the merging of conscious and unconscious. "that's right mekuru. i'm your unconscious trying to merge back with you.." //!!

Perhaps hanari dresses a bit more licentiously, leading Shiori to bluntly call her a nut gobbler. "Shiori I am begging you to learn how to self filter..." 

I am self filtering, though? //!!


White coral islands in a dark blue sea: The seeming of distinctness, the seeming of individuality --but all are only projections from the same sea bottom.Promontory //!!

mekuru learns the trick that she can keep bugging Alexa to say a red truth and if she doesn't it probably means something. at some point alexa should use this against her. probably with the shared existence one //!!

this statue is... aristophanes' archaic being.  //!!

"say you won't participate in this stupid game.' alexa becomes actually quite vicious with prima. this is confusing to everyone else who do not know why. for some reason muto, her husban sits by and watches with his arms crossed. he does nto seem like the type of man tot ake that sort of thing lying down. he doens't respond though. later:"i'm a man who listens to his gut. sometimes... you know... that you deserve something." //!!

When Alexa becomes pregnant, her personality subtly shifts. She "mellows out" according to everyone else. In fact, Alexa cries multiple times during her pregnancy, showing more emotion than anyone had ever seen of her. ("Even my mother has hormones," Mekuru says coldly) //!!

Lessie's such a weird name don't you think? It's like Lassie!  //!!

muto, what comeuppance could you possibly deserve and why? //!!

We know there's a cult! We know you eat the evil apples!//!!

She's shaken to her core, when she stares up through the skylight to see the light from the Fresnel lens. Her broken spirit tries to piece something together. Something between a plan for salvation and a plan for revenge. //!!

and don't calling me lessie. don't act familiar with me. alexa literally only does this with muto and prima. i've cleared out the bushes lessie, the gardener said. oh, thank you,//!!

//CONTENTDIVIDER !NOTMINE"
“Look what you made me do,” Shelly said.
A beat later, as the blood dripped from her daughter’s body,
Shelly suddenly changed her tone.
Strange words came out of her mouth, like some foreign
language.
“I’m sorry.”"Nikki let out a yelp that sounded like a wounded animal’s.white where the cold air had cooled them, pinkish in the still hot bathwater. Two-tone. Like a strawberry dipped in white chocolate.building castles in the sky out of diaphanous threads hooked to weak foundations."a denial
couched in blame."struts its feathers in an obscure beam of light, and crashes into the window, dying in silent fury.

//CONTENTDIVIDER TTS
Those children... shouldn't we just end their suffering? //!!

Shiori tastes the poisoned meal.to spit it out . alexa snatches it out fo her hands//!!

I can't stop myself from chuckling but shiori actually looks sad.//!!

"Heiress. It's the kiddy insults that hurt people the most. By the way you smell terrible. Must be because you're noveau riche trash."//!!

People get lost in the forest. Can't leave without permission //!!

It's just... A dumb story. If a precocious dumb girl who soaked up her wrath like a sponge and didn't know where to splash it//!!

They .. deserved... Everything. So did I. And what happened? did it make nayone happy?Mom getting lectured. //!!

There were... So many... Happy endings that could have been. //!!

It's... Basically scathing exegetical satire. It's almost... Puerile.//!!

Is... This what I look like to shiori...? I'm afraid to even ask.//!!

people accuse nick of doing dastardly things with it//!!

it's dasani! blame the coke company! pepsi company joke//!!

Even then you'd go through life not even remembering who you are... Haven't you noticed... Your reflection?//!!

sand filtered water. it tastes great. people like it. after,when the filter breaks donw, peopel have to drink the tap that nick brings in. //!!

a strange sullen break in the storm.//!!

all the heirs had a viable path, except for nick, who wasn't truly related to his mother, a great irony//!!

Hm? This fresnel lens is weird. it's like it's producing... a second beam downward? //!!

The lighthouse has always been like that he shrugged. Well. Not like tons of sailors were ever passing through here//!!

This is the first memory mekuru gets back fully. It feels good. It makes her happy. Oh I should have this after mekuru says she doesn't need her name.
Shiori talks about the lighthouse of Alexandria. You know, Alexandria means defender. They protected knowledge. //!!

At the harbor. What's the secret ingredient for the brownies. They're so good.
The demiurge...? No... He's a fool figure. He thinks he's god. That's the story. He created the material world because he believed himself the pinnacle of creation. And with it he created suffering //!!

They're Pillsbury he chuckled.//!!

"Locked" snitches. That they only figure out during the trial. Particularly the kurakiri one //!!

Alexa has a moment of chagrin. Isn't it ironic? Lessias supposed to mean defender.//!!

The sins of the village fell squarely on its weakest kid //!!

Right here. At the very bottom It's right belowThe light Every floor does the same skylight thing//!!

there are natural springs around here. that said, we did put filters, yes.//!!

Talking about Kyrie and clarie. Well they...became who... They each admired...//!!

at this point, in kyrie's mind, whoever was doing these kidnappings was fine murdering. if she really left and then killed, she couldn't stand it. she was certain whatever monika tried, she should be able to fend her off. //!!

actually kyrie probably directly meets alexa, and probably monika is already dead//!!

Mekuru and shiori we're changing hands a lot. It really made them into love starved waifs//!!

froze to death. burned to death. and then ears blown out. all at once.//!!

it's actually one long crazy night when kyrei, clarie, monika die.//!!

What a cruel joke.//!!

Monika herself leaves the note that she's gone somewhere else//!!

"what ... happened to the other scuba suit?' //!!

sounds to me like in her distress she could only think about her hobby could you blame her?"//!!

alexa constantly trying to send mekuru away. makes her seem super unloving. even says i don't care about you mekuru. go. //!!

good. with this, even though it's alexa doing a "good" thing, it comes off extremely negatively. which is great for managing reader perception of her//!!

alexa did not want mekuru to see her in the trial. "this is disgusting mother. "alexa flinched. //!!

nick originally sees her off. maybe with some nice boarding school lady. she pretends to get in the car. yadda yadda. something. oh. she pretended to have a stomach ulcer or something. //!!

Monika immolates herself performing the silly sulfur trick, so her body is discovered right by when screaming is heard//!!

alexa acting as prosecutor? a very small percentage majority votes for nick's guilt//!!

alexa tries to send mekuru off twice. first to boarding school or something. then later on with the doctor. mekuru returns both times.//!!

framing nick through insurance money.. classic. i was named the beneficiary?by the old man?//!!

perhaps nick can truthfully and perpetually testify that he saw her. a misty woman.  so it would sound like he was trying to pin everything on the boogieman. he tried to chase her but she disappeared.//!!

into sunlight? the jury asked doubtfully. that's right nick said.//!!

kyrie and clarie's father was a coal magnate, or so the story goes, who controlled labor in the town. he built most of the town proper too//!!

Nick is always talking about dishes and flavor profiles. Bitter like poison huh? Nick is always thoughtful.Accidentally switched sandwiches with shiori. Oh... That has horse radish.//!!

the children in the past could actulaly have simply gone through the coal mines maybe//!!

there are waterlogged parts of the connection between underneath the lighthouse //!!

Mekuru barely... Barely hears Shiori's voice across the void. Shiori feels her presence. //!!

  And Hana imitating Arcani with painting, while alphonse listens attentively as hannah talks about flowers//!!

Also clarie not being good at piano but it's not some awful thing. Just clumsy. //!!

..is... Is Kyrie a good writer. Clarie keeps her mouth shut.//!!

They run into the first tell tail snitch near arcani's place. It's the netabare apocryphon but it has no nest. Maybe. No. Would it be fine if it's girl X's?//!!

Well the doctor got in fine didn't she?//!!

Muto is an actual detective. Works with Kyrie and even clarie //!!

Shiori realizes it but keeps quietly eating while tearing up terribly. Mekuru sighs then takes a bite then nearly throws up.//!!

when the town floods, the people seem to fade into dust. they mix with the insipid water. but it's still water. mekuru is still about to drown.//!!

alexa actually is a really good swimmer. alexa brings her to the top of the light house. //!!

muto is the one who defends mekuru until the very end. //!!

i guess waechner stopped by and picked up prima and sort of "dissolved" the lighthouse//!!

i can make it a scene. alexa looking at prima with disgust resentment pain and fear. //!!

oh. i get it. even my mother shivers around her mother. //!!

final moment alexa and clarie just talk. wine in front of me. i'll tell you what clarie. we'll both drink one. how about one last game?//!!

nicer than usual, huh?//!!

the disappearance into the earth, like the pied piper//!!

 they walk around and come back on the place tghey came. oh i found the exit! no that's where we came from... oh... ah. there's like...a hearth... here. in themiddle...um... let's light it. this recalls the earlier scene in part vi where they had trouble lighting a fire. this wood must be ancient...bring the pillow out! but...but... it's all we've got ... shiori groans. once again an acrid nad chemical smell fills the air. //!!

alphonse likes crossword puzzles. he chuckled. you think sailors are dumb? i've been all over the world. when? shiori asked. hell if i remember. i'll tell you this. we've got just about the worst sand in the world. oh? where's the best sand in the world? the florida panhandle.//!!

with.. the exception of dangerous ones of course,' hannah frowns. someone planted some giants hogstail here. now we're dealing with it still. oh you actually do work sometimes, huh?//!!

they shift unsteadily while waiting for the fire to catch. the picture comes into view. ah... it's a weird hearth... almost like... a cupid's bow. a gag of flame and a collar of ash. it's alreaady decapitated. they actively notice this. worm like potrusion in ... you know where. four arms hold the sphere up like pillars on the next level. then three legs. oh... oh... ? it's the aristophanes human. well they're spheres with four arms and four legs. it was meant to be a joke. i don't get it. me neither. well, where's the fourth leg? then they see the giant snake worm penis
