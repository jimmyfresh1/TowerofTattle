//!! Episode 05 The Codex Assistant 

In episode 5, Alexa introduces herself, but this time as the assistant to The Codex Sussurokawa. ✓
Nx-e5 she shows them that it's one week before the first murder.✓
-cont: Alphonse and Monika come in. ✓
-cont: Alexa suddenly disappears✓
-cont-Alphonse: Hoo boy, I'm sorry to bring this lady around like this, but she insisted. ✓
-cont-Alphonse: Why, if it isn't lil' Shiori! ✓
ASP-c-Alphonse: What's the name of your friend, Shiori? ✓
ASP-c-Shiori: His name's Yorick!✓
ASP-sn-Shiori'sJournal //TTSAcquisition Shiori 1. Talks about heading to a new place. I'm tired of going away from place to place. ✓
ASP-c-Alphonse-Shiori "Little Shiori," he said with a big smile. "You dropped your magic show pamphlet at my place." ✓

Near-Shiori-Alphonse Memories come flooding back. That Shiori was left to her own devices, and Alphonse was the closest thing she had to a guardian here, and you couldn't call him much of one. One time she convinced me that we should try to ride down stream in a raft. 'Not scared of water back then." My mom was furious. ✓

//!! Sub-episode: The Creepy Peach.

ASP-c-Alphonse. Now you all wait a moment. I will lay down for a good minute. ✓
LOCUS: The Creepy Peach. He lives in The Creepy Peach with Hana. It's apparently because Hana wants to take care of him. But everyone knows it's kinda the other way around. ✓
ASP-c-Hana Introduce Hana.✓
-cont: Hana comes in. What are you girls doing here? ✓
-cont: - Why, you two are smelling wonderful today!✓
ASP-c-Shiori-Hana Shiori sees Hanari in

ASP-eSeance Hana's thirstiness can be an aid here. This can also be the first hint of the town's bizarre makeup.✓
ASP-sn-Belladonna We can reveal that very early on using Belladonna's Journal. I think it's highly appropriate. Introducing the idea of lineage and genetics.✓

ASP-c-Hana Yandere Hana to Nick. Hmm. You haven't been having a little amouerrete have you? Almost like she's sniffing Nick.✓
ASP-c-Nick: Actually, Nick can be introduced this episode. ✓
ASP-c-Nick: Nick actually delivers some meals. ✓
ASP-c-Hana: This place needs more kids. ✓
ASP-c-Mekuru I feel sort of uncomfortable with how she says it. Not in a "danger and suspicion" way. More in a "I feel bad for whoever ends up dating her" way. ✓


//!! Sub-episode: The Creepy Peach-study
ASP-eGarden Perhaps Hanari dresses a bit more licentiously, leading Shiori to bluntly call her a nut gobbler. "Shiori I am begging you to learn how to self filter..." ✓
-cont: I am self filtering, though?✓
ASP-c-Mekuru-Shiori Raid the study. Mekuru's heart starts racing as if she's really just a kid.  ✗
ASP-Mekuru-Shiori: They both realize that the sound of rustling paper is a sign of a TTS being nearby. ✓
ASP-sn-Apocryphon //TTSItem Stock photos of missing children. ✓
ASP-sn-Apocryphon //TTSAcquisition Netabare 1.✓
ASP-react-Netabare 1: It's kinda simpy... Sophia, the love of Arcani's life. ✓
ASP-c-Mekuru-Shiori-muse: What's the relation of this place to the Netabares? ✓
//TTSAcquisition Mekuru 2. What item? Oh it's a book about financial management. ✓

ASP-c-Nick Hannah, I cannot believe we are talking about children when we're not even dating.  ✓
ASP-c-Hannah "Fine, you brute!"// Arghhh! Hannah, come on! Nick glances at us.// I put at the door. "Al's with us. Come on Nick. Don't be a dope." Nick groans and runs out, continuing our little soap opera. And I feel my heart twinge painfully. Shiori's just as quiet.  ✓

//!! Sub-episode: The Creepy Peach-meal
ASP-c-Shiori-Mekuru-Clarie- Nick-Hana Nick and Hannah are will they won't they. Shiori: I always thought they were dating! Mekuru: Huh? Definitely not. They're not dating. I just <em>heard them say</em> they're not dating. // That's what people who are dating say! //No. No it really isn't.  ✓ //!! LATER: Nick: It's... complicated. 

-cont: Shiori: Wow, that smells really good.//It really does.//You don't smell it? ✗

//!! Passage AlphonseForest

ASP-c-Alphonse Alphonse likes crossword puzzles. He chuckled. You think sailors are dumb? I've been all over the world. When? Shiori asked. Hell if I remember. I'll tell you this. We've got just about the worst sand in the world. Oh? Where's the best sand in the world? The Florida panhandle. But that doesn't mean you should ever go to Florida. Never! Shiori said.
-cont: They walk down to town, from The Creepy Peach.  ✓

ASP-eSeance Soothsayer story. Alphonse tells the story of a sailor who could see the future and no wave could crash him. One day he looked to the future and saw himself unharmed on calm waters. You wanna know what happened? He starved! ✓


ASP-c-Alphonse "Shiori, did ya' know I escaped from Guantanimo Bay?" "Really?!" ✓
ASP-c-Mekuru-obsv The town is... diverse? Diverse is an understatement. Maybe I'm just short right now, but one of those fishermen looks like he's 20 feet.  ✓
ASP-c-Shiori "It's not a magic show! It's a ritual!"✓


ASP-c-Mekuru Oh! I know this one! I used to read this one all the time.✗
ASP-c-Shiori Really? She says dubiously.✗
ASP-c-Mekuru I open it up... //made up excerpt// "Yeah, I totally get that."// "Explain it then." // "No," I snap. "What am I, a monkey?" // ✓"Sorry," Shiori says sadly. // I'm sweating because I did not actually understand a lick of that. "Hm? What's this?"// Speaking of budgeting, ✓here's an order sheet? For ether? //TTSAcquisition Belladonna 1. ✗
ASP-sn-react-Belladonna1 Don't you think this is a little too coincidental? ✗
ASP-react-sn-Belladonna Belladonna? Wow. Just wow.✗
ASP-c-Shiori Shiori doesn't seem happy about it either. But she's thinking. "It doesn't quite make sense, though..."// "I mean I hate to say it, but it's hard to argue with. Who else do we know with a great sense of smell?" "No, that's the thing," Shiori says sounding a little confused. "Hannah's sense of smell is awful." ✗

ASP-e5,e6 "Thinking back, so many times my mom seemed to look more bewildered than anything. It was like the only thing in the world she wasn't great at was being a mom. Like she avoided it sometimes because she didn't like not being the best at something."✓

ASP-c-Shiori-Hana "G-goodness," Shiori says, a twelve year old trying to talk like an aristocrat. Umm... verily. ✓

Seance Beats ✓
ASP-c-Alexa: I'm stopping this.✓
-cont: Tyrant!✓
-cont: Soccer mom!✓

ASP-c-Alphonse-Alexa Now Lessia, I think it's unfair to blame me for not realizing an event being held in our very courthouse was going to turn out like this.✓
ASP-c-Alexa Sure, Al. I'm convinced. Now say that to Shiori. 
ASP-c-Alphonse groans knowing she's absolutely right. ✓




swing-1-Alexa-Al Alexa dresses Al down, Mekuru acts a bit teeny ✓
-c-Alexa: "What were you thinking being there?" ✓
-cont-Alphonse: "I'm sorry. I thought it was just... some kind of magic show." ✓
-cont-Mekuru: "Maybe if you'd been paying attention, you would've caught us."✓
-cont-Alexa: "Maybe you're right..." she muttered. ✓
-cont-Mekuru: I didn't expect that. And as we rode in the car back, everything silent, Shiori sleeping with her head rested against Alphonse, ✓
I realized it hurt more that she said that. ✓


                Al's fallen asleep along with Shiori. 
                "Just wait here a moment."
                "No." I decide to be proactive. I'm coming in.
                Alexa raises an eyebrow.  She stays silent much longer than I'd expect. "Suit yourself."
                ASP-eMuto'sHouse-desc: A bunch of 90s stuff. Like Alex's Lake House. 
                It's a small trailer home. I guess some people in Sussurokawa live like this too. I feel bad saying it, but I know people see it as trashy. Inside, though, it's almost clean and tasteful. Almost.
                Crystals. Shelves full of the occult. But it's all neat and compartmentalized. Like someone had set strict borders for the crazy.
                In the very corner a gun safe. 
                I can't help but think lately that wood tells the tale. My whole house feels like it's made of oak. There's oak here, too, standing out as the nicest pieces of furniture. A desk in the corner, separated from all the crazy. The shelf with all the occult spans the entire long wall beside the door. 
                The counters though, and the dining table are pine, and actually rustic. Not the fake rustic you usually see. They're scratched and clearly used, if not secondhand.

                ASP-intro-Magi literature at prima's house 

                ASP-intro-c-Prima "Say that you won't participate in this stupid game."
                Honestly I can't help but think it's... childish. 
                ASP-e5 And don't call me Lessie. don't act familiar with me. Alexa literally only does this with Muto and Prima. I've cleared out the bushes Lessie, the gardener said. Oh, thank you!
                Getting heated outside.


                This is confusing to everyone else who do not know why. For some reason Muto, her husband sits by and watches with his arms crossed. he does nto seem like the type of man to take that sort of thing lying down. he doesn't respond though. later:"I'm a man who listens to his gut. Sometimes... you know... that you deserve something." 



//Episode Garden

ASP-c-Alphonse Alphonse talks about all kinds of junk scams. They're learning new tricks. Hand written.
ASP-reveal 


ASP-eGarden Um. Why are we hiding from your mom?// Because we didn't dress up for the party. // Ok? She's an NPC.
-cont: //Then you go up to her. Go on. // Er, I don't feel like it!" Shiori said rubbing her ears. //Still, I just don't feel like we're doing anything useful...
-cont: Ugh. My mom got stupidly dressed for this. She put on some really tacky red lipstick... //Mekuru, this is a waste of time. You're using toy binoculars!// 
-cont: We don't have time for this! Shiori stamped her foot. "We have to recover your 'self'! Everything else is just a sideshow! Shiori snapped. Or at least as much as Shiori could snap. "You're... You're right. I'm getting caught up."
-cont: N...no... you're right. I'm paying attention to stupid stuff. But I just... This can be useful. //But looking at them isn't going to matter if we can't even hear them.
-cont: I can hear them. Barely.//All the way from here?//Yeah... just almost.//Hi//Eeek! Shiori and I jump in unison.
-cont: Clarie pops up. //Cl...Clarie?//I always remembered her as someone like Boo Radley. I guess when this party was going on, she was hanging out in the actual house?
-cont: Why aren't you with adults? Hookie? Fight with mom?//Er... There's pretty much no way to explain, 'we're trying to solve a murder, and a few days from now you're one of the victims!'
-cont: We're shy and want to know more about Hanari.//Why not ask?//We're nosy kids. Can't ask some things of a lady. Or they'll hit you.//Hana doesn't hit. She's kind. And gentle.//No, no! She totally does! Totally!
-cont: Must have said something insensitive like you always do. Shiori lines.//I just said she had a pretty name! Because she's pretty just like a flower!//And then?
-cont: And that Hannah was the name of a Biblical lady who really wanted Biblical kids. And that Hana's baby clock is ticking and she sniffed out Nick as the only good match for miles, so it was like, you know, romantic!
-cont: Even I wanted to hit her for that one.//Uhuh. Story checks out. Good karate chop on head for that one, deserved.//It still hurt though..//You're eavesdropping?//Calm down. Breathe in. Stop trying to shut out the ambient noise.
-cont: Scene describing Mekuru's hearing improving, whispers in the air, making her shudder.//
-cont: I can't believe you're actually making cider from that orchard. You've always been such a pain about it just because you hate apples!
-cont: Nick you ugly bastard! Stop stringing her along.
-cont: Ahhh... Hana, if only you were my actual daughter!
-cont: I'm telling you. There were children. They all disappeared. They would've been your age by now, he growled. 
-cont: Ok pops, what about us? They must have thought you were ugly like sin.
-cont: They disappeared into the Earth like the Pied Piper!//Last time you said they were whisked away to the ocean, Nick groans. 
-cont: I have picture evidence! // I know what it looks like, pops, but it's <em>digitally edited.</em>// That is not possible. Comptuers can't do that sort of thing. 



ASP-eGarden Hana's sniffing out his wallet... Shiori gaped.
-cont: Hana should just find someone else from outside the town, I said, my brain trying to forget that was a totally meaningless prospect.
-cont: And how's Nick feel?//Not repulsed. But a little weirded out. When we were toddlers, she babysat us pretty sure. Can't remember too well.
-cont: Are you serious? She's a dinosaur.//Clarie frowns. "She was only a teenager. Not that bad age difference."//A teenaged dinosaur.//If you want to know more about her, come with.
-cont: You learn a lot looking at someone's art.The two of us were transfixed. We'd never seen anything like it. It was...Awful.
-cont: "Mm. Not great. Al's got an eye for great art, but no heart to say she's no Picasso. Nick's too cowardly to mention her complete lack of taste. Kyrie won't say it gives her the heeby jeebies." 
-cont: "And you?" "Don't like to hear cutting words. Won't say them." "Mom's honest, though." "Your mother is often mean. White noise." 
-cont: She's right, but somehow I don't like how bluntly she said it.
-cont: Mekuru can't help herself and she turns her ears on more powerfully. Clarie kindly shuts her ears. 'It's ok. you don't have to.'


-cont: It looks like The Scream... oh my god, is that Nick? I... actually am not sure. // Look, he's screaming, just like the Munch painting!
-cont: No. In the Munch Painting, it's a common misconception. He's not screaming himself. He hears it. Screaming.//...who? Whose scream? Who's... screaming? "...nature. Nature's infinite scream."
-cont: "Actually, based on the sky's strange color and the time of the pai-"//"Some hackfrauds think the scream is Krakatoa exploding. Silly. Needlessly impoverishes the piece. No imagination." 
-cont: Shiori falls silent and simply puffs up her cheeks while squeezing Yorick to her chest.//...sorry. Said too much. Sometimes my tongue's still sharp. "Oh, Shiori always pouts."
-cont: "No, to you. Said too much about your mother.// "I don't care. Say what you want about her."//No. You looked sad.
-cont: Mekuru relates to the Infinite Scream. Even right now, she feels like...// I should... go. Be good.//Clarie goes back.
-cont: Now Alexa pops up. 
-cont: Ahhh! Where do you even come from?! Where were you?
-cont: I got lost in a book, she said sadly.
-cont: Alexa leads them to something important like the family statue. It's in the drawing room. 
-cont: Consumarre Est Coniungi. 
-cont: //TTSAcquisition Unlock a Belladonna 1Probably bleeding cone.

ASP-eu "...And she just happened to also be part of a cult." "No, no, it's more like all the cults are kinda connected. Especially those Gnostic ones like the Freemasons and the Netabares, you know. Like, I've got this cousin thrice removed who's part of The El Los IIlluminados in LA. They're super scary. Oh! OH! This one time, they got these two guys from Brazil and just locked them up in these masks and -" 
ASP-eu "Just a couple of... loveless waifs." 

ASP-c-Hana Talks about children and their dreams and so forth. She keeps talking about children and children's dreams in a bit of a new agey way. //!! Hana is a Judas lamb, so she is also the best insight as to what the children were like in the past. 


ASP-c-Mekuru-Shiori: They actually find his glasses in the study. 
ASP-c-Alexa: Alexa makes them wash their hands. 
-cont: Never hurts to be safe, children!



//Episode Seance. 





ASP-eSeanceThe first Consumere Est Coniungi beat is at Hana's place. This one emphasizes copulation, coitus.
