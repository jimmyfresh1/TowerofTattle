//CONTENTDIVIDER PART I

In Part I Mekuru opens up talking about the Tower. There's an Arekusa quote about The Root. Mekuru is bothered by the whispers. That's when Shiori comes in. Mekuru's heart swells at the reunion, not even remember who she is, but Shiori is kind of annoying and sets Mekuru off, who stomps off to another part of The Tower. Mekuru starts feeling sorry for herself, reading more books of secrets, but that's when Shiori pops in again. Shiori quiets the books. 

//CONTENTDIVIDER PART II

Mekuru watches as Shiori works out how to open up The Gate. She muses to herself she'd be happy to stay by Shiori's side. But she feels insecure. Shiori solves the puzzle and makes Mekuru solve it, pointing out all of the Waechner 8 stuff. She narrows it down to one shelf. Mekuru has to pick out the fake book, which is from the narcissist. Yon-chi I think. They descend

//CONTENTDIVIDER THIS PART DIVIDES PARTS OF THE STORY I'VE ALREADY WRITTEN].


//Episode 1
In episode 01, we have the campfire scene. In the campfire scene, Shiori explains that murders happened, the town disappeared, and that Prima Pagetta came back.

//Episode 2

In episode 02, we have the forest walk. In the forest, Mekuru begins to have some of her memories come back. They sit down to a view of The Lighthouse, and Shiori talks about The Root for a little bit.
//Episode 3

In episode 03, a telltail snitch leads them to Alexa's Hideout. There, they find Girl X's first journal. Girl X's journal talks about how she's hiding away in that cave. This is also where they encounter The Codex Sussurokawa, which contains that journal. Mekuru continues feeling a little alienated from Shiori. It's at this point, they hear someone coming. It's Alexa, or Mekuru's mother, though the reader doesn't know yet. Mekuru observes her and gives a description. Chapter ends with the cliffhanger: Mekuru, it's your mom! 
//Episode 4

In episode 04, they talk to her mom. Alexa acts a bit weird, and seems shocked, and Mekuru and Alexa have a mother daughter squabble. Shiori does cute Shiori things, and Alexa pulls her cheeks apart. Mekuru gets really emotional about it, knowing that Alexa is an NPC (she's not, but they thnik that she is.) Alexa tells them to go to the house and wash up. At the house, Shiori and Mekuru find Mekuru's diary. Cute princes entry. Mekuru slams it shut.

ASP-c-Hana Hana talked about running away sometimes with Nick. But why? From what? Nick isn't sure logically, but emotionally he gets it.




ASP-relocate? Chiraoscuro churrasco? Shiori asked, her stomach growling





<!-- -cont: "Dammit!" // Shiori gasps, "you can't say that Mu!" // Ugh. This is the worst. //It's kinda like the mu. You could say it was like you're your mom's purpose, Shiori says trying to be bright and optimistic. -->



-ASP-eGarden-c-Hana With.. the exception of dangerous ones of course,'  Hannah frowns. Someone planted some giants hogstail here. Now we're dealing with it still. Oh you actually do work sometimes, huh?

ASP-m-Hana Mekuru sees a vision of a young girl being forced to eat a dish while crying. An unseen figure is glowering over her





//EPISODE Trial

ASP-PVI-c-Mekuru-Shiori "That's right. We don't have shared memories because... My mom tried to send me away." 
ASP-PVI-c-Muto Muto at one point has to stop someone who's physically threatening Shiori. He sighs with relief. The tension all leaves his body. Sits down, puts his hand to his forehead. You wanna know something Shiori, he says with a derisive smile. The gun's fake. 
ASP-PVI Monika herself leaves the note that she's gone somewhere else
ASP-c-Nick-pre-Trial There's something in the water! You're all drinking water bottles. I suppose you're gonna say that there's a huge conspiracy going on with Aquifina?
ASP-eTrial Nick truthfully testifies he saw a woman disappear into mist. "On that sunny day?" "I saw what I saw. " He tried to chase her but she disappeared.
ASP-c-mob-Shiori crazy Cultist tries to kill Shiori, and her powers flare up and hurt him
ASP-desc The small jail can't have more than 4 or 5 cells. 
ASP-desc That cell is... unfortunately the safest place for her right now. 
Don't reveal till part 7 that Muto faked being attacked by Shiori. 
ASP-c-Shiori "Why would... Muto say that about me?"





//EPISODE Inn and Clinic 
ASP-PVI There are waterlogged parts of the connection between underneath the lighthouse.
ASP-PVI-desc-maybe: White coral islands in a dark blue sea: The seeming of distinctness, the seeming of individuality --but all are only projections from the same sea bottom. Promontory. 
ASP-PVI-town There are six statues. Aat the courthouse Sophia and Adam. at the botanical garden, the dryad and the naiad. At the inn, the angelic sisters where one of the angel sisters covers the other's ear. 
ASP-PVI Cried when she got pregnant. Oh great, really makes me feel loved. "No... it was different. I'd never seen her cry. Ever.' Then IVF is discovered. Paradox. Why would she cry if she was intentional? 'Were they tears of joy?" Clarie stayed silent, uncharacteristically seeming to squirm a bit.

//EPISODE FINAL MURDERS
You know what. I'll split the second set of murders to PART VII. Actually, idk. That really undercuts the Marina. 


//EPISODE Marina

ASP-locus-marina-c-Clarie: Clarie: "You're young. Your life's ahead of you, should be able to move on from tragedy. Hope springs eternal. 
ASP-locus-marina-c-Nick: At the marina. What's the secret ingredient for the brownies. They're so good.
They're Pillsbury he chuckled. (he hands over the recipe, which leads to the last secret recipe)
-cont: Wow. I can't believe how stupid that is.
-cont: Mekuru keeps crying. 
ASP-locus-marina: The final recipe is just Nick's favorite meal. Made with love! A meal for an aching heart. 

//EPISODE Lighthouse Approach

ASP-locus-lighthouse: Hm? This fresnel lens is weird. It's like it's producing... a second beam downward? 



//Episode Unsorted

ASP-plot-A magician's secret. One of the greatest secrets. 
ASP-c-Shiori or... like a magic trick.  (EP 10)

ASP-sn-Apocryphon //TTSCONTENT  Ontogeny recapitulates cosmogeny. 
ASP-sn-Apocryphon //TTSCONTENT "There's a point of creation. One thing becomes two. If you want to reverse it, two becomes one."
ASP-eu //TTSCONTENT Shadows are bound to earth. They can't leave Earth.

//!! Mekuru 
ASP-eu Mekuru founds out IVF. "Wait you're saying that I'm... From... In... vitro... fertilization? Are you... What?! HUH?!"
ASP-c-Mekuru-Alexa-post-trial You're a disgusting person,' I'd said to my mom. I still remember how the words tasted coming off my mouth. 
ASP-c-Mekuru: Oh. Don't worry. I always expected that I was adopted. My mom and I don't even have the same color hair. It's obvious, really. 
-cont-Shiori: "Er um... it's not quite that!"
ASP-locus-Clinic: IVF Find. //TTSAcquisition Both Kyrie's Notes, and Mekuru 2. 
ASP-PVI-maybe Haven't you seen the brain proportioned homunculus? It's got huuuuge hands. "I have no idea what you're talking about," I said, slightly miffed that Shiori always talked like I had the last fifteen years to read like she did.
ASP-u-There's a rest here... Mekuru is dead...
-cont: Actually it was an illusion.

ASP-eu Telltail snitches like their sunshine. They want everything out in the open!
-cont: There's a lot vannaknoes here... Seems like they're attracted to the dark, decrepit, and unseemly.
ASP-eu Of course a corpse is disgusting. The sight of it makes me want to throw up. But my emotions...
I don't want her to know I'm a freak whose emotions are dying.
ASP-eu "But how did you even know I was here? In Waechner's Vault?" I ask.// "D-don't you mean the Tower of Tattle?" she asks me.  // "...sure," I say, more than slightly aware that something about being back here seems to be affecting my apparent 'innocence.'

ASP-c-Shiori "Of course! The Codex is just one big vannaknoe!"
ASP-c-Shiori Of course they wouldn't be friends? Shiori says quizzically. Vannaknoes are a telltail snitch's number one predator. 
ASP-u At some point Mekuru's memories are gated by The Codex eating snitches hidden by vannaknoes. It's sort of like a big fish eating a small fish.
LORE-revise Hannah explicitly set "all the children free." Aka, all those under a certain age. 
-cont: Arcani ate (and made Hannah) eat Eris out of some weird form of respect. 
-cont: Arcani ate his own brother. 
-cont: Eris managed the games.




//!! Alexa
ASP-m-Alexa-Alphonse "For a moment I can't see. Then it's like a blindfold is taken off my face."
-cont: The sun glares, and the figure's back is turned. The voice sounds familiar, but unfamiliarly cruel, so I can't quite place it.
-cont: Oho. You're a hateful little thing, aren't you? But you hide it. Not like those sisters. They can only hide the surface.
-cont: You're not afraid of the light are you? No matter any shadow it casts?
ASP-PVI Fake out that Girl X died.
ASP-PVI Alexa and Kyrie go to the lighthouse, ostensibly to fix the carousel. Highly suspicious but Alexa's body turns up later. 
ASP-e-Trial Alexa takes on swagger like Jim Jagger, a lawyer throwing words and words to see what sticks, almost folksy. She has a chameleon demeanor.
ASP-sn-Kyrie Kyrie forces //TTSCONTENT Alexa to go to therapy with her and Mekuru, which makes Alexa chafe. Alexa finds it hilarious and ironic and is in complete contempt of her


ASP-c-Nick Did he sound like he was hypnotized? No. He sounded like he was acting very badly. 
ASP-c-Shiori Shiori expresses preternaturalness as separate from supernatural




ASP-c-Alexa Wild laughter and Alexa giggles. Are Kusa is wild grass, wwwwwwww.
ASP-c-Alexa-assistant The demiurge...? No... He's a fool figure. He thinks he's god. That's the story. He created the material world because he believed himself the pinnacle of creation. And with it he created suffering.
ASP-c-Alexa-assistant It's a faun and a naiad. // It's two angels. // It's a statue of Sophia.
ASP-c-Alexa Alexa constantly trying to send Mekuru away. Makes her seem super unloving. Even says I don't care about you Mekuru. Go. 
ASP-c-Alexa-prosecutor "What ... happened to the other scuba suit?' // Sounds to me like in her distress she could only think about her hobby could you blame her?
ASP-c-Alexa-TTS //TTSAcquisition Final TTS of Part VI is THE DOOR IS OPEN. Which reveals the first cipher. 




//!! Shiori
<!-- ASP-PVI Have to do Mekuru-Shiori arc stuff. Probably right before garden party. After Shiori brings a bunch of stuff back.  -->

ASP-c-Shiori-post-ClarieDeath Shiori has a very public display of magic power, which makes everyone incredibly suspicious. 
<!-- ASP-c-Shiori We're closer to their core. Who they are. Sometimes you feel something more than your own name. -->
ASP-c-Shiori Shiori makes inappropriate baby factory joke? Honestly, yes, probably at some point it's gotta happen
ASP-c-Shiori-post-Al-and-Hannah "You know, at some point... you have to learn that people die," Shiori said quietly. "Everyone knows people die. But no one knows it from the start." 
<!-- ASP-c-Shiori Both Alexa and Arcani have gray eyes, or gunslinger eyes. Pow pow! Shiori makes a joke. -->
<!-- ASP-c-Mekuru-Shiori Mekuru and Shiori were changing hands a lot.  -->
ASP-c-Shiori A telltail snitch and vannaknoe are picking at each other. "Shouldn't they be friends?" "Yeah... frenemies, more like. They both think the other is really shameless." Immediately followed by journal beat of Shiori and Mekuru being shameless and acting like a vannaknoe and telltail snitch respectively. 


ASP-u I love you, Mekuru!' Shiori chirped (in caesar cipher, but Mekuru hyperfocusing doesn't notice. You too Yorick! Y belu oek Cuakhk! Oek jee Oehysa!)


ASP-c-Shiori Some people try to worship Shiori
ASP-c-Mekuru-eu Ah. I get it. It's the reasonable ones who are the most disgusting. When Ithought of witch hunts, I thought of belligerent screaming people. But now I realize the worst ones act like they're concerned. Everything sounds nice until you realize they think their mild manners justifies executing a young girl to save their skin. I hate their quietly demurring voices




//!! Nick 

                        ASP-c-Nick Nick is always talking about dishes and flavor profiles. Bitter like poison huh? Nick is always thoughtful.Accidentally switched sandwiches with Shiori. Oh... That has horse radish.
                        -cont-Shiori: Shiori realizes it but keeps quietly eating while tearing up terribly. Mekuru sighs then takes a bite then nearly throws up.
                        ASP-c-Nick When Alexa becomes pregnant, her personality subtly shifts. She "mellows out" according to everyone else. In fact, Alexa cries multiple times during her pregnancy, showing more emotion than anyone had ever seen of her. ("Even my mother has hormones," Mekuru says coldly)
                        ASP-c-Nick  Nick, having a pretty good read on people: "Was she really doing her best for me? Can't say I think so. Still, I always got the sense I was one of the few people she could stand. Your mom's got her reasons. "To have you killed?" Nick gave a long a hard look like he'd eaten something sour. "This town's... different Mekuru. I don't expect you to get it. A kid shouldn't have to."
                        ASP-c-Nick Your mom's pretty good at everything, honestly. 

                                                ASP-c-Nick-Alexa She would say things like ‘Oh, are we having a nice day?’ but it didn’t sound like she cared—it was sarcastic and derisive.” But then she mellowed out."

                        
                        ASP-c-Nick The Crecer family technically owns the farm. Well. More than a few people think I'm cozying up to her because I want to own it. You ever run a farm? It sucks. 

//!! Alphonse and Hana 

ASP-c-Alexa-Alphonse Creaking gate always hangs the longest, Alexa says about Alphonse.
ASP-locus-Clinic: So it's like when a KFC and a Taco Bell use the same building! Shiori said. Kyrie facepalms. 
ASP-PVI Alexa trying to rouse suspicion in Clarie, leads them to the Voynich Manuscript Page in the Inn. 
ASP-react-Kaobu: Wait. That doesn't make sense. Hands aren't part of the face. Ugh! I hate readers like you! Stop it! You're the worst!
ASP-c-Kyrie: You can feel petals, or you can feel thorns, Kyrie said. It's up to you.
ASP-c-Shiori-Clarie: The light chases after the dark, Clarie said plaintively. //What? That doesnt make sense, Shiori said. Lights the fastest thing!// Hush, Shiori, Mekuru said, miffed. //Shiori: No! //Then Kyrie says actually I thought the same thing. 
ASP-c-Clarie: A fugue is an escape. One voice flees, the other chases, a question and an answer...Clarie said.
ASP-c-Shiori: Like a fugueitive!
ASP-c-Clarie: Clarie sings, and Mekuru and Shiori are transfixed.
ASP-c-Clarie: Is Kyrie a good writer? Clarie keeps her mouth shut.
ASP-c-Clarie-Kyrie Talking about Kyrie and clarie. Well they...became who... They each admired...
ASP-sn-item "The woman inside the child inside me." "The wolf inside the woman inside the child inside me."
ASP-c-Clarie-Kyrie Kyrie and Clarie's father was a coal magnate, or so the story goes, who controlled labor in the town. He built most of the town proper too. 
ASP-c-Clarie I don't... like the sound of my own voice.
ASP-PVI Look, it's a list of names... Jeanne Mills? Um. You know. She escaped from the People's Temple. Jim Jones? Guyana? Koolaid? All that jazz. Well some people think it was a CIA thing, yeah... 



//!! Muto and Prima
ASP-c-Muto Everyone understands muto as quite brave, but he sees himself as a coward
ASP-PVI: I notice that one of the cadaver bags has a hole poked in it.  // All Mekuru remembers at first. "You put something to make her sleep hard, didn't you?" "I'm not gonna drink it." Muto has a grave look on his face.
ASP-c-Muto Are you telling me you woke up this morning and decided to wear a gorget? "Are you telling me you didn't wear yours today?'


//Episode PVII 



ASP-PVII-c GIANT MOVING STATUE Solo Leveling 
ASP-PVII-c-Monika Monika immolates herself performing the silly sulfur trick, so her body is discovered right by when screaming is heard
ASP-PVII They shift unsteadily while waiting for the fire to catch. the picture comes into view. Ah... it's a weird hearth... Almost like... a cupid's bow. A gag of flame and a collar of ash. It's already decapitated. They actively notice this worm like protrusion in the area of you-know-where.Four arms hold the sphere up like pillars on the next level. Then three legs. Oh... oh... ? It's the aristophanes human. Well, they're spheres with four arms and four legs. It was meant to be a joke. I don't get it. Me neither. Well, where's the fourth leg? Then they see the giant snake worm penis.

ASP-PVII They walk around and come back to the place they came. Oh! I think I found the exit! No, that's where we came from... oh... Ah. There's like...a hearth... here. In the middle...um... let's light it. This recalls the earlier scene in Part VI where they had trouble lighting a fire. This wood must be ancient...bring the pillow out! But...but... it's all we've got ... Shiori groans. Once again an acrid nad chemical smell fills the air. 

ASP-locus-Sirens-PVII: Those aren't angels, those are sirens... 
ASP-PVII It's... Basically scathing exegetical satire. It's almost... Puerile.
ASP-PVII A hunting ground... no... It... no way. It's not a hunting ground... It was a farm. 
ASP-PVII The statue that analogizes Nick and Hanari. Instead of offering a grape, Nick is just biting Hanari's Neck, while Hanari is slitting Nick's wrist and smelling the blood boquet.
ASP-PVII So Sussurokawa Cove would've been like... a hunting ground for the Netabare family? I mean, it makes sense. It's secluded, superstitious, easy to kidnap people from presumably... 
ASP-PVII As they descend through the fake lighthouse, consumption ciphers are revealed with each door opened. This one eats this one, etc.

ASP-PVII Oh. I get it. Even my mother shivers around her mother. 
ASP-PVII Alexa looks at Prima with disgust, resentment, and fear. 
ASP-PVII Final moment. Alexa and Clarie just talk. Wine in front of me. I'll tell you what clarie. We'll both drink one. How about one last game?
ASP-PVII Everything seems to point to Kyrie at first. Mekuru somewhat callousedly reasons that it's her. Shiori denies it vehemently down to her soul. But they find out about Kurakira. Shiori is crushed. But she works to exonerate Kyrie. And accidentally (incorrectly) implicates herself. 
-cont-Clarie: nicer than usual, huh?
ASP-PVII Umm... I suppose it's like... Thinking because you've broken through Earth's crust, you're anywhere near the core. It's a brilliant achievement, reaching the mantle. But ...
-cont-maybe: Comparison between the mantle, the incinerator, the glow of magma. 
ASP-PVII Shiori: But...but...! How were you googling things!!!
ASP-PVII The headphones were just a way to lead dimwits off my track.// Shiori gasps in offense. 
ASP-PVII Don't say another goddamned word.??It was uncharacteristically stupid, Mekuru said sharply.??She became the pathAlexa was... afraid to go down into the dark.??Maybe the town floods, Mekuru nearly drowns, but Alexa saves her. "I thought I told you to leave!"
ASP-PVII It's okay Shiori, tell the truth. I won't be mad no matter what it is. The more info I get, the more i'm sure i can prove shiori's innocence. Shiori TTS: Today I reanimated Nick's corpse  "... Okay, I'm a little freaking mad. " Y-you said you wouldn't be mad! "I'm not mad," I lie. 
ASP-PVII It's like online homework programs that only accept really specific answers. This is foreshadowed with the 'everyone but shiori and mekuru is a magi' answer. Then finally it's used for the ALEXA PAGE answer. //Fakeout, where Alexa tries to convince Mekuru that she's her 'other self.' 
ASP-PVII The kind of pattern you might see rendered in cheap linoleum, referring to Masonic Mosaic, but here it's rendered in marble. 
ASP-PVII-maybe Mekuru stutters saying someone just made themselves look like Nick when forced to try and explain the corpse reanimation.
ASP-PVII Shiori shudders as Alexa plays her gambit. Coniunctio as in... the merging of conscious and unconscious. "That's right, Mekuru. I'm your unconscious trying to merge back with you."
ASP-PVII Magi are... very zero sum creatures, shiori said sadly. for all their brilliance, any resource, they can only really imagine stealing it... Truth can only be reached by consuming the ignorant.. 
ASP-PVII Isn't she just clearly in denial? She barely believes herself. She looks like she's being polygraphtested.
ASP-PVII "Say it in red, then,' I spit out. "Mekuru and Alexa share their existence." (Mekuru is shook) 
ASP-PVII No! Yorick's a good boy! 
ASP-PVII What makes more sense to you? Someone who wasn't there made a ritual that nobody knows about, or that one extremely powerful and spiteful little girl's powers flew off the handle? 
ASP-PVII So the secret potion is... distilled water. "Well, when you think about it, if you had to drug someone without them knowing, it should probably be tasteless like water." 
ASP-PVII-desc Once the spell is nearly done, the entire ocean surrounding turns pitch black. As if it's a giant trough. The stream flowing down into it, resembling both Alexa's dream, and also the slaughterhouse.
ASP-PVII-lore Ruha instead of Sophia in the vandalization
ASP-PVII-lore Ur, the worm, instead of Adam. 
ASP-PVII-lore Either Alexa or Shiori notes the Demiurge is a fool figure
ASP-PVII-lore Murky and black waters from Gonsticism are used as a linking motif, especially in the vandalized poems, that reflect the descent into the water
ASP-PVII-lore The grandest expression of contempt is the vandalization of sophia and adam into a single aristophanean archaic human. The statue has the inscription big miss folly. It is circumambulated and decapitated, a reference to Osiris. 
ASP-PVII-lore The undertower has many freemason motifs. the masonic mosaic pavement with white and black patterned tiles. Instances of the masonic blazing star, a blazing sun, a circle of brass with tendrils of gold and silver. 

ASP-PVIII It's just... A dumb story. If a precocious dumb girl who soaked up her wrath like a sponge and didn't know where to splash it.
ASP-PVIII They .. deserved... Everything. So did I.// And what happened? Did it make nayone happy? Mom getting lectured.  // There were... So many... Happy endings that could have been. 
ASP-PVIII When the town floods, the people seem to fade into dust. They mix with the insipid water. But it's still water. Mekuru is still about to drown.
ASP-PVIII Muto is the one who defends mekuru until the very end. 
ASP-PVIII We know there's a cult! We know you eat the evil apples
ASP-c-Alexa-PVIII She's shaken to her core, when she stares up through the skylight to see the light from the Fresnel lens. Her broken spirit tries to piece something together. Something between a plan for salvation and a plan for revenge.
ASP-PVIII Mekuru learns the trick that she can keep bugging Alexa to say a red truth and if she doesn't it probably means something. At some point Alexa should use this against her. Probably with the shared existence one 
ASP-PVIII Alexa is stunned when Mekuru says that Shiori is gone. The one thing she hadn't expected was for anyone to be able to find their way out. that means they overcame some kind of escape barrier. 
ASP-Ending Mekuru barely... Barely hears Shiori's voice across the void. Shiori feels her presence. 

ASP-PVII Making the statues crumble in order 
ASP-PVIII
Doll house for murder staging 
Shadows of children?
Shadows of the Kaobu?
