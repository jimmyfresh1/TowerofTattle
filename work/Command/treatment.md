//CONTENTDIVIDER PART I

In Part I Mekuru opens up talking about the Tower. There's an Arekusa quote about The Root. Mekuru is bothered by the whispers. That's when Shiori comes in. Mekuru's heart swells at the reunion, not even remember who she is, but Shiori is kind of annoying and sets Mekuru off, who stomps off to another part of The Tower. Mekuru starts feeling sorry for herself, reading more books of secrets, but that's when Shiori pops in again. Shiori quiets the books. 

//CONTENTDIVIDER PART II

Mekuru watches as Shiori works out how to open up The Gate. She muses to herself she'd be happy to stay by Shiori's side. But she feels insecure. Shiori solves the puzzle and makes Mekuru solve it, pointing out all of the Waechner 8 stuff. She narrows it down to one shelf. Mekuru has to pick out the fake book, which is from the narcissist. Yon-chi I think. They descend

//CONTENTDIVIDER THIS PART DIVIDES PARTS OF THE STORY I'VE ALREADY WRITTEN].


//Episode 1
In episode 01, we have the campfire scene. In the campfire scene, Shiori explains that murders happened, the town disappeared, and that Prima Pagetta came back.

//Episode 2

In episode 02, we have the forest walk. In the forest, Mekuru begins to have some of her memories come back. They sit down to a view of The Lighthouse, and Shiori talks about The Root for a little bit.
//Episode 3

In episode 03, a telltail snitch leads them to Alexa's Hideout. There, they find Girl X's first journal. Girl X's journal talks about how she's hiding away in that cave. This is also where they encounter The Codex Sussurokawa, which contains that journal. Mekuru continues feeling a little alienated from Shiori. It's at this point, they hear someone coming. It's Alexa, or Mekuru's mother, though the reader doesn't know yet. Mekuru observes her and gives a description. Chapter ends with the cliffhanger: Mekuru, it's your mom! 
//Episode 4

In episode 04, they talk to her mom. Alexa acts a bit weird, and seems shocked, and Mekuru and Alexa have a mother daughter squabble. Shiori does cute Shiori things, and Alexa pulls her cheeks apart. Mekuru gets really emotional about it, knowing that Alexa is an NPC (she's not, but they thnik that she is.) Alexa tells them to go to the house and wash up. At the house, Shiori and Mekuru find Mekuru's diary. Cute princes entry. Mekuru slams it shut.

//ADMONITION ASP-Creatio Ex Nihilo, World of Light, World of Dark, consumere est coniungi, 
//ADMONITION Prima, Monika, and Muto respectively represent different town perspectives. Prima is a silly holistic medicine woman Wiccan bordering on cultist. Monika is a schizo conspiracy theorist. Muto is normal.
//ADMONITION Sussurokawa has a weird crazy amount of diversity. At the very end, as the magic wears off, everyone starts displaying chimera traits.

ASP-c-Alphonse-Shiori "Little Shiori," he said with a big smile. "You dropped your magic show pamphlet at my place." ✓

Near-Shiori-Alphonse Memories come flooding back. That Shiori was left to her own devices, and Alphonse was the closest thing she had to a guardian here, and you couldn't call him much of one. One time she convinced me that we should try to ride down stream in a raft. 'Not scared of water back then." My mom was furious.





//!! Sub-episode: The Creepy Peach.

ASP-c-Alphonse. Now you all wait a moment. I will lay down for a good minute. ✓
LOCUS: The Creepy Peach. He lives in The Creepy Peach with Hana. It's apparently because Hana wants to take care of him. But everyone knows it's kinda the other way around. ✓
ASP-c-Hana Introduce Hana.✓

ASP-c-Shiori-Hana "G-goodness," Shiori says, a twelve year old trying to talk like an aristocrat. Umm... verily. 
ASP-eSeanceThe first Consumere Est Coniungi beat is at Hana's place. This one emphasizes copulation, coitus.✓
ASP-eSeance Hana's thirstiness can be an aid here. This can also be the first hint of the town's bizarre makeup.✓
ASP-sn-Belladonna We can reveal that very early on using Belladonna's Journal. I think it's highly appropriate. Introducing the idea of lineage and genetics.✓
ASP-c-Hana Hana talked about running away sometimes with Nick. But why? From what? Nick isn't sure logically, but emotionally he gets it.
ASP-c-Hana Yandere Hana to Nick. Hmm. You haven't been having a little amouerrete have you? Almost like she's sniffing Nick.✓
ASP-c-Nick: Actually, Nick can be introduced this episode. ✓
ASP-c-Nick: Nick actually delivers some meals. ✓
ASP-c-Hana: This place needs more kids. ✓
ASP-c-Mekuru I feel sort of uncomfortable with how she says it. Not in a "danger and suspicion" way. More in a "I feel bad for whoever ends up dating her" way. ✓


//!! Sub-episode: The Creepy Peach-study
ASP-eGarden Perhaps Hanari dresses a bit more licentiously, leading Shiori to bluntly call her a nut gobbler. "Shiori I am begging you to learn how to self filter..." ✓

//TTSAcquisition Mekuru 2. What item? Oh it's a book about financial management. ✓
ASP-c-Mekuru Oh! I know this one! I used to read this one all the time.✓
ASP-c-Shiori Really? She says dubiously.✓
ASP-c-Mekuru I open it up... //made up excerpt// "Yeah, I totally get that."// "Explain it then." // "No," I snap. "What am I, a monkey?" // ✓"Sorry," Shiori says sadly. // I'm sweating because I did not actually understand a lick of that. "Hm? What's this?"// Speaking of budgeting, ✓here's an order sheet? For ether? //TTSAcquisition Belladonna 1. ✓
ASP-sn-react-Belladonna1 Don't you think this is a little too coincidental? ✓
ASP-react-sn-Belladonna Belladonna? Wow. Just wow.✓
ASP-c-Shiori Shiori doesn't seem happy about it either. But she's thinking. "It doesn't quite make sense, though..."// "I mean I hate to say it, but it's hard to argue with. Who else do we know with a great sense of smell?" "No, that's the thing," Shiori says sounding a little confused. "Hannah's sense of smell is awful." ✓


//!! Sub-episode: The Creepy Peach-meal
ASP-c-Shiori-Mekuru-Clarie- Nick-Hana Nick and Hannah are will they won't they. Shiori: I always thought they were dating! Mekuru: Huh? Definitely not. They're not dating. I just <em>heard them say</em> they're not dating. // That's what people who are dating say! //No. No it really isn't.  //!! LATER: Nick: It's... complicated. 

-cont: Shiori: Wow, that smells really good.//It really does.//You don't smell it? ✗
ASP-c-Mekuru I look at Shiori like, can we actually eat this? Shiori looks back at me like, wow, free food!
ASP-c-Hana Talks about children and their dreams and so forth. She keeps talking about children and children's dreams in a bit of a new agey way. //!! Hana is a Judas lamb, so she is also the best insight as to what the children were like in the past. 
ASP-c-Nick Hannah, I cannot believe we are talking about children when we're not even dating.
ASP-c-Hannah "Fine, you brute!"// Arghhh! Hannah, come on! Nick glances at us.// I put at the door. "Al's with us. Come on Nick. Don't be a dope." Nick groans and runs out, continuing our little soap opera. And I feel my heart twinge painfully. Shiori's just as quiet. 


//!! Passage AlphonseForest

ASP-c-Alphonse Alphonse likes crossword puzzles. He chuckled. You think sailors are dumb? I've been all over the world. When? Shiori asked. Hell if I remember. I'll tell you this. We've got just about the worst sand in the world. Oh? Where's the best sand in the world? The Florida panhandle. But that doesn't mean you should ever go to Florida. Never! Shiori said.
-cont: They walk down to town, from The Creepy Peach. 

ASP-eSeance Soothsayer story. Alphonse tells the story of a sailor who could see the future and no wave could crash him. One day he looked to the future and saw himself unharmed on calm waters. You wanna know what happened? He starved!


ASP-c-Alphonse "Shiori, did ya' know I escaped from Guantanimo Bay?" "Really?!"
ASP-c-Mekuru-obsv The town is... diverse? Diverse is an understatement. Maybe I'm just short right now, but one of those fishermen looks like he's 20 feet. 

//!! The Seance

ASP-epitaph: Sophia. 
ASP-intro-Kaobu. 
ASP-eSeance The seance takes place in the courthouse.
ASP-e5 Alphonse takes Shiori and Mekuru to the seance.
ASP-e5 Monika does a cold reading bit with Shiori. The reader is introduced to the idea that both Shiori and Mekuru are partially pulled emotionally into the original events. 
ASP-e5 Alexa comes in, angry, because Monika is cold reading Mekuru.

ASP-c-Shiori "It's not a magic show! It's a ritual!"
ASP-intro-KiraKiri
ASP-c-Monika-Shiori: Those hands! Do you feel the tremors of the heart?
ASP-c-Shiori: "I don't want to be here anymore..."
ASP-c-Monika: Makes the declaration of what's going to happen. YOU! 
ASP-c-Monika: (points at Alphonse) You have little time left. You of the eye. 
-cont-Alphonse: Alphonse only guffaws in response. 
-cont-Monika: All of you <em>on Rumeuri Hill. </em>
-cont-Monika: (hones in on Mekuru)
-cont-Alexa: "Don't you dare touch her."
-cont-Monika: 'The Oracle who had no problem antagonizing everyone else seemed to freeze."
-cont-Alexa: "No. Of course we won't unmask you. But we will clean this place up and ask you to leave. And question you about your rabble rousing."
-cont-Monika: "Seriously?"

ASP-c-Alexa: I'm stopping this.
-cont: Tyrant!
-cont: Soccer mom!

ASP-c-Alphonse-Alexa Now Lessia, I think it's unfair to blame me for not realizing an event being held in our very courthouse was going to turn out like this.
ASP-c-Alexa Sure, Al. I'm convinced. Now say that to Shiori. 
ASP-c-Alphonse groans knowing she's absolutely right. 

ASP-c-Alexa: "What were you thinking being there?"
-cont-Alphonse: "I'm sorry. I thought it was just... some kind of magic show." 
-cont-Mekuru: "Maybe if you'd been paying attention, you would've caught us."
-cont-Alexa: "Maybe you're right..." she muttered. 
-cont-Mekuru: I didn't expect that. And as we rode in the car back, everything silent, Shiori sleeping with her head rested against Alphonse, I realized it hurt more that she said that. 


ASP-intro-c-Muto 
ASP-intro-c-Prima "Say that you won't participate in this stupid game."

ASP-c-Mekuru-e5 Mekuru can't also help but be pulled into childishness. Now we're sitting there eating a big bowl of cereal. 

ASP-c-mob "I've seen her. The woman in the fog. Kirakiri." 
-cont: Shiori is uncomfortable


ASP-e5 They're going to drop off Shiori at Monika's place. It's dark and empty. She's probably off fooling around at the bar, Alexa tsked.
-cont-Alexa: We can wait here until she's back.
-cont-Shiori: Pl-lease... I don't...
-cont-Alexa: (gives in) I guess until the garden party... Monika'll be there, too. 
-cont-Shiori: (runs in to grab her things)
-cont-Alexa: Mekuru. I want you to tell me you won't be participating in these things anymore.
-cont-Mekuru: Are you kidding me? Of course, I won't.
-cont-Alexa: Say it.
-cont-Mekuru: Huh?
-cont-Alexa: Say 

ASP-c-Shiori: Comes back with a floppy disk. 
ASP-c-Mekuru: Where the heck are we gonna find a computer? I've only seen one in my life. It's in my mom's office and I don't really want to...


ASP-e5 And don't call me Lessie. don't act familiar with me. Alexa literally only does this with Muto and Prima. I've cleared out the bushes Lessie, the gardener said. Oh, thank you!
ASP-e5 Lessie's such a weird name, don't you think? It's like Lassie!

ASP-eSeance "Say you won't participate in this stupid game.' Alexa becomes actually quite vicious with Prima. This is confusing to everyone else who do not know why. For some reason Muto, her husban sits by and watches with his arms crossed. he does nto seem like the type of man to take that sort of thing lying down. he doens't respond though. later:"I'm a man who listens to his gut. Sometimes... you know... that you deserve something." 
-cont: Muto, what comeuppance could you possibly deserve and why?

ASP-eSeanc-relocate? Chiraoscuro churrasco? Shiori asked, her stomach growling


//Episode Garden

ASP-c-Alphonse Alphonse talks about all kinds of junk scams. They're learning new tricks. Hand written.
ASP-reveal 


ASP-eGarden Um. Why are we hiding from your mom?// Because we didn't dress up for the party. // Ok? She's an NPC.
-cont: //Then you go up to her. Go on. // Er, I don't feel like it!" Shiori said rubbing her ears. //Still, I just don't feel like we're doing anything useful...
-cont: Ugh. My mom got stupidly dressed for this. She put on some really tacky red lipstick... //Mekuru, this is a waste of time. You're using toy binoculars!// 
-cont: We don't have time for this! Shiori stamped her foot. "We have to recover your 'self'! Everything else is just a sideshow! Shiori snapped. Or at least as much as Shiori could snap. "You're... You're right. I'm getting caught up."
-cont: N...no... you're right. I'm paying attention to stupid stuff. But I just... This can be useful. //But looking at them isn't going to matter if we can't even hear them.
-cont: I can hear them. Barely.//All the way from here?//Yeah... just almost.//Hi//Eeek! Shiori and I jump in unison.
-cont: Clarie pops up. //Cl...Clarie?//I always remembered her as someone like Boo Radley. I guess when this party was going on, she was hanging out in the actual house?
-cont: Why aren't you with adults? Hookie? Fight with mom?//Er... There's pretty much no way to explain, 'we're trying to solve a murder, and a few days from now you're one of the victims!'
-cont: We're shy and want to know more about Hanari.//Why not ask?//We're nosy kids. Can't ask some things of a lady. Or they'll hit you.//Hana doesn't hit. She's kind. And gentle.//No, no! She totally does! Totally!
-cont: Must have said something insensitive like you always do. Shiori lines.//I just said she had a pretty name! Because she's pretty just like a flower!//And then?
-cont: And that Hannah was the name of a Biblical lady who really wanted Biblical kids. And that Hana's baby clock is ticking and she sniffed out Nick as the only good match for miles, so it was like, you know, romantic!
-cont: Even I wanted to hit her for that one.//Uhuh. Story checks out. Good karate chop on head for that one, deserved.//It still hurt though..//You're eavesdropping?//Calm down. Breathe in. Stop trying to shut out the ambient noise.
-cont: Scene describing Mekuru's hearing improving, whispers in the air, making her shudder.//
-cont: I can't believe you're actually making cider from that orchard. You've always been such a pain about it just because you hate apples!
-cont: Nick you ugly bastard! Stop stringing her along.
-cont: Ahhh... Hana, if only you were my actual daughter!
-cont: I'm telling you. There were children. They all disappeared. They would've been your age by now, he growled. 
-cont: Ok pops, what about us? They must have thought you were ugly like sin.
-cont: They disappeared into the Earth like the Pied Piper!//Last time you said they were whisked away to the ocean, Nick groans. 
-cont: I have picture evidence! // I know what it looks like, pops, but it's <em>digitally edited.</em>// That is not possible. Comptuers can't do that sort of thing. 



ASP-eGarden Hana's sniffing out his wallet... Shiori gaped.
-cont: Hana should just find someone else from outside the town, I said, my brain trying to forget that was a totally meaningless prospect.
-cont: And how's Nick feel?//Not repulsed. But a little weirded out. When we were toddlers, she babysat us pretty sure. Can't remember too well.
-cont: Are you serious? She's a dinosaur.//Clarie frowns. "She was only a teenager. Not that bad age difference."//A teenaged dinosaur.//If you want to know more about her, come with.
-cont: You learn a lot looking at someone's art.The two of us were transfixed. We'd never seen anything like it. It was...Awful.
-cont: "Mm. Not great. Al's got an eye for great art, but no heart to say she's no Picasso. Nick's too cowardly to mention her complete lack of taste. Kyrie won't say it gives her the heeby jeebies." 
-cont: "And you?" "Don't like to hear cutting words. Won't say them." "Mom's honest, though." "Your mother is often mean. White noise." 
-cont: She's right, but somehow I don't like how bluntly she said it.
-cont: Mekuru can't help herself and she turns her ears on more powerfully. Clarie kindly shuts her ears. 'It's ok. you don't have to.'


-cont: It looks like The Scream... oh my god, is that Nick? I... actually am not sure. // Look, he's screaming, just like the Munch painting!
-cont: No. In the Munch Painting, it's a common misconception. He's not screaming himself. He hears it. Screaming.//...who? Whose scream? Who's... screaming? "...nature. Nature's infinite scream."
-cont: "Actually, based on the sky's strange color and the time of the pai-"//"Some hackfrauds think the scream is Krakatoa exploding. Silly. Needlessly impoverishes the piece. No imagination." 
-cont: Shiori falls silent and simply puffs up her cheeks while squeezing Yorick to her chest.//...sorry. Said too much. Sometimes my tongue's still sharp. "Oh, Shiori always pouts."
-cont: "No, to you. Said too much about your mother.// "I don't care. Say what you want about her."//No. You looked sad.
-cont: Mekuru relates to the Infinite Scream. Even right now, she feels like...// I should... go. Be good.//Clarie goes back.
-cont: Now Alexa pops up. 
-cont: Ahhh! Where do you even come from?! Where were you?
-cont: I got lost in a book, she said sadly.
-cont: Alexa leads them to something important like the family statue. It's in the drawing room. 
-cont: Consumarre Est Coniungi. 
-cont: //TTSAcquisition Unlock a Belladonna 1Probably bleeding cone.
-cont: "Dammit!" // Shiori gasps, "you can't say that Mu!" // Ugh. This is the worst. //It's kinda like the mu. You could say it was like you're your mom's purpose, Shiori says trying to be bright and optimistic.



-ASP-eGarden-c-Hana With.. the exception of dangerous ones of course,'  Hannah frowns. Someone planted some giants hogstail here. Now we're dealing with it still. Oh you actually do work sometimes, huh?

ASP-m-Hana Mekuru sees a vision of a young girl being forced to eat a dish while crying. An unseen figure is glowering over her

ASP-PVI Monika herself leaves the note that she's gone somewhere else

ASP-PVI Cried when she got pregnant. Oh great, really makes me feel loved. "No... it was different. I'd never seen her cry. Ever.' Then IVF is discovered. Paradox. Why would she cry if she was intentional? 'Were they tears of joy?" Clarie stayed silent, uncharacteristically seeming to squirm a bit.

//EPISODE FINAL MURDERS

They're Pillsbury he chuckled. (he hands over the recipe, which leads to the last secret recipe)

ASP-eu Mekuru founds out IVF. "Wait you're saying that I'm... From... In... vitro... fertilization? Are you... What?! HUH?!"
ASP-c-Mekuru-Alexa-post-trial You're a disgusting person,' I'd said to my mom. I still remember how the words tasted coming off my mouth. 
ASP-c-Mekuru: Oh. Don't worry. I always expected that I was adopted. My mom and I don't even have the same color hair. It's obvious, really. 
-cont-Shiori: "Er um... it's not quite that!"
ASP-locus-Clinic: IVF Find. //TTSAcquisition Both Kyrie's Notes, and Mekuru 2. 
ASP-PVI-maybe Haven't you seen the brain proportioned homunculus? It's got huuuuge hands. "I have no idea what you're talking about," I said, slightly miffed that Shiori always talked like I had the last fifteen years to read like she did.
ASP-u-There's a rest here... Mekuru is dead...
-cont: Actually it was an illusion.

ASP-eu Telltail snitches like their sunshine. They want everything out in the open!
-cont: There's a lot vannaknoes here... Seems like they're attracted to the dark, decrepit, and unseemly.
ASP-eu Of course a corpse is disgusting. The sight of it makes me want to throw up. But my emotions...
I don't want her to know I'm a freak whose emotions are dying.
ASP-eu "But how did you even know I was here? In Waechner's Vault?" I ask.// "D-don't you mean the Tower of Tattle?" she asks me.  // "...sure," I say, more than slightly aware that something about being back here seems to be affecting my apparent 'innocence.'
ASP-eu "...And she just happened to also be part of a cult." "No, no, it's more like all the cults are kinda connected. Especially those Gnostic ones like the Freemasons and the Netabares, you know. Like, I've got this cousin thrice removed who's part of The El Los IIlluminados in LA. They're super scary. Oh! OH! This one time, they got these two guys from Brazil and just locked them up in these masks and -"

"We could open a restaurant here!" "No. No way. This place doesn't have the economy for it. We'd have to move to the big city and do it." Alexa hopping mad. Forces them to eat it.
ASP-m "We're doing a perpetual stew! I've got chocolate." "You know what? Keep to your side of the stew." a memory mekuru has. that corresponds to her taste being enhanced. 
ASP-e5,e6 "Thinking back, so many times my mom seemed to look more bewildered than anything. It was like the only thing in the world she wasn't great at was being a mom. Like she avoided it sometimes because she didn't like not being the best at something."

ASP-m-Alexa-Alphonse "For a moment I can't see. Then it's like a blindfold is taken off my face."

ASP-eu Shiori explains the "grand prank" aspect of rituals. "...well, I'm not saying it's FUNNY."
-cont: This kind of thing is well documented actually. It's like different hands in mahjong. They all win, but some give you more points.
ASP-c-Shiori-post-ClarieDeath Shiori has a very public display of magic power, which makes everyone incredibly suspicious. 
ASP-c-Shiori We're closer to their core. Who they are. Sometimes you feel something more than your own name.
ASP-c-Shiori Shiori makes inappropriate baby factory joke? Honestly, yes, probably at some point it's gotta happen
ASP-c-Shiori "You know, at some point... you have to learn that people die," Shiori said quietly. "Everyone knows people die. But no one knows it from the start." 
ASP-c-Shiori Both Alexa and Arcani have gray eyes, or gunslinger eyes. Pow pow! Shiori makes a joke.
ASP-c-Mekuru-Shiori Mekuru and Shiori were changing hands a lot. 
ASP-c-Shiori A telltail snitch and vannaknoe are picking at each other. "Shouldn't they be friends?" "Yeah... frenemies, more like. They both think the other is really shameless." Immediately followed by journal beat of Shiori and Mekuru being shameless and acting like a vannaknoe and telltail snitch respectively. 
ASP-c-Shiori Shiori expresses preternaturalness as separate from supernatural
ASP-react-TTS-Netabare2 //TTSCONTENT So like Cotton Eyed Joe? Shiori asks. 
ASP-u I love you, Mekuru!' Shiori chirped (in caesar cipher, but Mekuru hyperfocusing doesn't notice. You too Yorick! Y belu oek Cuakhk! Oek jee Oehysa!)
ASP-PVI Shiori is seen playing with Novelites. 
ASP-sn-Shiori3 //TTSContent Shiori talking about playing with Novelites. 
ASP-c-Mekuru You're telling me you went around chirping 'creatio ex nihilo' and 'reductio ad nihilum?!' I wanted to strangle my client
ASP-c-Shiori Some people try to worship Shiori
ASP-c-Mekuru-eu Ah. I get it. It's the reasonable ones who are the most disgusting. When Ithought of witch hunts, I thought of belligerent screaming people. But now I realize the worst ones act like they're concerned. Everything sounds nice until you realize they think their mild manners justifies executing a young girl to save their skin. I hate their quietly demurring voices




//!! Nick 
ASP-c-Nick Shiori and Mekuru eating candy cutely while Nick scratches his head.
ASP-c-Nick looked a little uncomfortable. This isn't a topic for kids. But somehow it seems we can bully him into talking with his NPC behavior. His eyes glaze over a bit, and he sounds a bit like a recording, feeling suddenly very mannequinish. I guess they really are pliable after all.
ASP-c-Nick The second consumere est coniungi is during nick's scene somewhere. another statue or something is observed. here, consumere as eating is emphasized.
ASP-c-Nick Mental disease (like Hinamazawa Syndrome) runs through the area. Maybe it's the mist that's always floating on through. I don't know. I really hope... you kids can just get out of here. People go nuts around here. We've got a lot of nutjobs. That's why Kyrie's made it her mission to raise this place out of superstition, to help people with their mental illness. I'd say it's valiant but futile. Lately more and more people are showing symptoms.
ASP-c-Nick There's... some kind of disease that runs through these parts. My mother... decided to ... end her life at one point. "I'm so sorry..." "No," Nick scratched his cheek. "It's not a fun story, but life goes on. You have to keep going. You just have to. But... it's not a story for kids to hear. I never wanted you guys to hear it. Clarie and Kyrie's father..." "And Hana's mother...?" "No, we... we don't know what happened to her. She disappeared one day. I guess we're all... hoping she just up and left. Hana's never been able to deal with it since. Al took her in as if she was his daughter."
ASP-c-Nick You know my mom had a secret recipe book... She... well. She burned it, and ... let's just say she intentionally isn't here with us anymore. 
ASP-c-Nick Schmutzdecke.
ASP-c-Nick-Hana Rotting flowers. Rotting roses. Softly rotting. Quietly rotting. This is Nick's perception of Hanari after the tragic incident.
ASP-c-Nick Are we dating? No. But I do love her. 
-cont: Shiori gasped. "You love her? You want to marry her?"
-cont: "Shh! For god's sake, if she heard you say that..." // "Hana... needs to get better before we can date. Maybe I sound crazy but. I believe it." // "It wouldn't help her. She doesn't need a boyfriend. She doesn't need a husband. She doesn't need a child. She needs a friend."
-cont: "You're a really good guy, Nick." // "Uhuh. I like you Nick. That's why everyone likes you except Al." // "So even kids notice it?" 
ASP-c-Nick-Alexa She would say things like ‘Oh, are we having a nice day?’ but it didn’t sound like she cared—it was sarcastic and derisive.” But then she mellowed out."
ASP-c-Shiori-Nick  "I wanna churn butter!" Nick seemed relieved with the conversation change. 
ASP-c-Nick There are natural springs around here. That said, we did put filters, yes.
ASP-c-Nick Nick is always talking about dishes and flavor profiles. Bitter like poison huh? Nick is always thoughtful.Accidentally switched sandwiches with Shiori. Oh... That has horse radish.
-cont-Shiori: Shiori realizes it but keeps quietly eating while tearing up terribly. Mekuru sighs then takes a bite then nearly throws up.
ASP-c-Nick When Alexa becomes pregnant, her personality subtly shifts. She "mellows out" according to everyone else. In fact, Alexa cries multiple times during her pregnancy, showing more emotion than anyone had ever seen of her. ("Even my mother has hormones," Mekuru says coldly)
ASP-c-Nick  Nick, having a pretty good read on people: "Was she really doing her best for me? Can't say I think so. Still, I always got the sense I was one of the few people she could stand. Your mom's got her reasons. "To have you killed?" Nick gave a long a hard look like he'd eaten something sour. "This town's... different Mekuru. I don't expect you to get it. A kid shouldn't have to."




//!! Alphonse and Hana 

ASP-c-Alexa-Alphonse Creaking gate always hangs the longest, Alexa says about Alphonse.
ASP-locus-Clinic: So it's like when a KFC and a Taco Bell use the same building! Shiori said. Kyrie facepalms. 
ASP-PVI Alexa trying to rouse suspicion in Clarie, leads them to the Voynich Manuscript Page in the Inn. 
ASP-react-Kaobu: Wait. That doesn't make sense. Hands aren't part of the face. Ugh! I hate readers like you! Stop it! You're the worst!
ASP-c-Kyrie: You can feel petals, or you can feel thorns, Kyrie said. It's up to you.
ASP-c-Shiori-Clarie: The light chases after the dark, Clarie said plaintively. //What? That doesnt make sense, Shiori said. Lights the fastest thing!// Hush, Shiori, Mekuru said, miffed. //Shiori: No! //Then Kyrie says actually I thought the same thing. 
ASP-c-Clarie: A fugue is an escape. One voice flees, the other chases, a question and an answer...Clarie said.
ASP-c-Shiori: Like a fugueitive!
ASP-c-Clarie: Clarie sings, and Mekuru and Shiori are transfixed.
ASP-c-Clarie: Is Kyrie a good writer? Clarie keeps her mouth shut.
ASP-c-Clarie-Kyrie Talking about Kyrie and clarie. Well they...became who... They each admired...
ASP-sn-item "The woman inside the child inside me." "The wolf inside the woman inside the child inside me."
ASP-c-Clarie-Kyrie Kyrie and Clarie's father was a coal magnate, or so the story goes, who controlled labor in the town. He built most of the town proper too. 
ASP-c-Clarie I don't... like the sound of my own voice.
ASP-PVI Look, it's a list of names... Jeanne Mills? Um. You know. She escaped from the People's Temple. Jim Jones? Guyana? Koolaid? All that jazz. Well some people think it was a CIA thing, yeah... 



//!! Muto and Prima
ASP-c-Muto Everyone understands muto as quite brave, but he sees himself as a coward
ASP-PVI: I notice that one of the cadaver bags has a hole poked in it.  // All Mekuru remembers at first. "You put something to make her sleep hard, didn't you?" "I'm not gonna drink it." Muto has a grave look on his face.
ASP-c-Muto Are you telling me you woke up this morning and decided to wear a gorget? "Are you telling me you didn't wear yours today?'


//Episode PVII 

ASP-PVII-c-Monika Monika immolates herself performing the silly sulfur trick, so her body is discovered right by when screaming is heard
ASP-PVII They shift unsteadily while waiting for the fire to catch. the picture comes into view. Ah... it's a weird hearth... Almost like... a cupid's bow. A gag of flame and a collar of ash. It's already decapitated. They actively notice this worm like protrusion in the area of you-know-where.Four arms hold the sphere up like pillars on the next level. Then three legs. Oh... oh... ? It's the aristophanes human. Well, they're spheres with four arms and four legs. It was meant to be a joke. I don't get it. Me neither. Well, where's the fourth leg? Then they see the giant snake worm penis.

ASP-PVII They walk around and come back to the place they came. Oh! I think I found the exit! No, that's where we came from... oh... Ah. There's like...a hearth... here. In the middle...um... let's light it. This recalls the earlier scene in Part VI where they had trouble lighting a fire. This wood must be ancient...bring the pillow out! But...but... it's all we've got ... Shiori groans. Once again an acrid nad chemical smell fills the air. 

ASP-locus-Sirens-PVII: Those aren't angels, those are sirens... 
ASP-PVII It's... Basically scathing exegetical satire. It's almost... Puerile.
ASP-PVII A hunting ground... no... It... no way. It's not a hunting ground... It was a farm. 
ASP-PVII The statue that analogizes Nick and Hanari. Instead of offering a grape, Nick is just biting Hanari's Neck, while Hanari is slitting Nick's wrist and smelling the blood boquet.
ASP-PVII So Sussurokawa Cove would've been like... a hunting ground for the Netabare family? I mean, it makes sense. It's secluded, superstitious, easy to kidnap people from presumably... 
ASP-PVII As they descend through the fake lighthouse, consumption ciphers are revealed with each door opened. This one eats this one, etc.

ASP-PVII Oh. I get it. Even my mother shivers around her mother. 
ASP-PVII Alexa looks at Prima with disgust, resentment, and fear. 
ASP-PVII Final moment. Alexa and Clarie just talk. Wine in front of me. I'll tell you what clarie. We'll both drink one. How about one last game?
ASP-PVII Everything seems to point to Kyrie at first. Mekuru somewhat callousedly reasons that it's her. Shiori denies it vehemently down to her soul. But they find out about Kurakira. Shiori is crushed. But she works to exonerate Kyrie. And accidentally (incorrectly) implicates herself. 
-cont-Clarie: nicer than usual, huh?
ASP-PVII Umm... I suppose it's like... Thinking because you've broken through Earth's crust, you're anywhere near the core. It's a brilliant achievement, reaching the mantle. But ...
-cont-maybe: Comparison between the mantle, the incinerator, the glow of magma. 
ASP-PVII Shiori: But...but...! How were you googling things!!!
ASP-PVII The headphones were just a way to lead dimwits off my track.// Shiori gasps in offense. 
ASP-PVII Don't say another goddamned word.??It was uncharacteristically stupid, Mekuru said sharply.??She became the pathAlexa was... afraid to go down into the dark.??Maybe the town floods, Mekuru nearly drowns, but Alexa saves her. "I thought I told you to leave!"
ASP-PVII It's okay Shiori, tell the truth. I won't be mad no matter what it is. The more info I get, the more i'm sure i can prove shiori's innocence. Shiori TTS: Today I reanimated Nick's corpse  "... Okay, I'm a little freaking mad. " Y-you said you wouldn't be mad! "I'm not mad," I lie. 
ASP-PVII It's like online homework programs that only accept really specific answers. This is foreshadowed with the 'everyone but shiori and mekuru is a magi' answer. Then finally it's used for the ALEXA PAGE answer. //Fakeout, where Alexa tries to convince Mekuru that she's her 'other self.' 
ASP-PVII The kind of pattern you might see rendered in cheap linoleum, referring to Masonic Mosaic, but here it's rendered in marble. 
ASP-PVII-maybe Mekuru stutters saying someone just made themselves look like Nick when forced to try and explain the corpse reanimation.
ASP-PVII Shiori shudders as Alexa plays her gambit. Coniunctio as in... the merging of conscious and unconscious. "That's right, Mekuru. I'm your unconscious trying to merge back with you."
ASP-PVII Magi are... very zero sum creatures, shiori said sadly. for all their brilliance, any resource, they can only really imagine stealing it... Truth can only be reached by consuming the ignorant.. 
ASP-PVII Isn't she just clearly in denial? She barely believes herself. She looks like she's being polygraphtested.
ASP-PVII "Say it in red, then,' I spit out. "Mekuru and Alexa share their existence." (Mekuru is shook) 
ASP-PVII No! Yorick's a good boy! 
ASP-PVII What makes more sense to you? Someone who wasn't there made a ritual that nobody knows about, or that one extremely powerful and spiteful little girl's powers flew off the handle? 
ASP-PVII So the secret potion is... distilled water. "Well, when you think about it, if you had to drug someone without them knowing, it should probably be tasteless like water." 
ASP-PVII-desc Once the spell is nearly done, the entire ocean surrounding turns pitch black. As if it's a giant trough. The stream flowing down into it, resembling both Alexa's dream, and also the slaughterhouse.
ASP-PVII-lore Ruha instead of Sophia in the vandalization
ASP-PVII-lore Ur, the worm, instead of Adam. 
ASP-PVII-lore Either Alexa or Shiori notes the Demiurge is a fool figure
ASP-PVII-lore Murky and black waters from Gonsticism are used as a linking motif, especially in the vandalized poems, that reflect the descent into the water
ASP-PVII-lore The grandest expression of contempt is the vandalization of sophia and adam into a single aristophanean archaic human. The statue has the inscription big miss folly. It is circumambulated and decapitated, a reference to Osiris. 
ASP-PVII-lore The undertower has many freemason motifs. the masonic mosaic pavement with white and black patterned tiles. Instances of the masonic blazing star, a blazing sun, a circle of brass with tendrils of gold and silver. 

ASP-PVIII It's just... A dumb story. If a precocious dumb girl who soaked up her wrath like a sponge and didn't know where to splash it.
ASP-PVIII They .. deserved... Everything. So did I.// And what happened? Did it make nayone happy? Mom getting lectured.  // There were... So many... Happy endings that could have been. 
ASP-PVIII When the town floods, the people seem to fade into dust. They mix with the insipid water. But it's still water. Mekuru is still about to drown.
ASP-PVIII Muto is the one who defends mekuru until the very end. 
ASP-PVIII We know there's a cult! We know you eat the evil apples
ASP-c-Alexa-PVIII She's shaken to her core, when she stares up through the skylight to see the light from the Fresnel lens. Her broken spirit tries to piece something together. Something between a plan for salvation and a plan for revenge.
ASP-PVIII Mekuru learns the trick that she can keep bugging Alexa to say a red truth and if she doesn't it probably means something. At some point Alexa should use this against her. Probably with the shared existence one 
ASP-PVIII Alexa is stunned when Mekuru says that Shiori is gone. The one thing she hadn't expected was for anyone to be able to find their way out. that means they overcame some kind of escape barrier. 
ASP-Ending Mekuru barely... Barely hears Shiori's voice across the void. Shiori feels her presence.
