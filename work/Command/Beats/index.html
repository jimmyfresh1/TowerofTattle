            <p class="swing" contenteditable="true">Strange memories on this nervous night...</p>
            <p class = "beat2" contenteditable="true">When? Will it come again?</p>
            <p class = "beat1"contenteditable="true">Maybe it meant something. Maybe not.</p>
            <p class = "beat2"contenteditable="true">But no mix of words will ever convey it.</p>

            <p class="swing" contenteditable="true">History is hard to know</p>
            <p class="beat3" contenteditable="true">Even without being sure . . . the energy comes to head in a long flash, for reasons no one understands...</p>
            
            <p class="swing" contenteditable="true">My central memory</p>
            <p class="beat1">...when I left Filmore half-crazy...</p>
            <p class="beat1">instead of going home, aimed across the Bay Bridge a hundred miles an hour...</p>
            <p class="beat1">... L.L. Bean shorts and a Butte sheepherder's jacket...</p>
            <p class="beat1">...booming through the Treasure Island Tunnel...</p>
            <p class="beat1">... not quite sure which turn-off to take...</p>
            <p class="beat1">always stalling at the toll-gate...</p>
            <p class="beat2">but being absolutely certain that no matter which way I went I would come to a place where people were just as high and wild as I was.</p>
            <p class="beat2">No doubt at all about that...</p>
            <p class="beat2">There was madness in every direction, at any hour.</p>
            <p class="beat2">If not across the Bay, then up the Golden Gate...</p>
            <p class="beat2">You could see sparks anywhere.</p>
            <p class="beat2">There was a fantastic universal sense . . . that we were winning.</p>
            <p class="admonition">Here's the speech clincher...!</p>
            <p class="swing" contenteditable="true">And the wave... breaks...</p>
            <p class="rest1">And that, I think was the handle.</p>
            <p class="rest1">That sense of inevitable victory over the forces of Old and Evil.</p>
            <p class="beat2">There was no point in fighting.</p>
            <p class="beat1">We had all the momentum...</p>
            <p class="beat1">We were riding the crest of a high and beautiful wave...</p>
            <p class="rest2">So now, less than five years later... with the right kind of eyes, you can almost see the high-water mark... that place where the wave finally broke and rolled back.</p>
