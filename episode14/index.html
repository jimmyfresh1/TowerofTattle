                        You hear it too. Right? Nature's scream.
                        You're just gonna leave us here? To our own devices?

                        What harm could kids do? Don't get kidnapped. That's all. Watch out for Hannah if she comes at you with a rag.

                        That is... a very uncomfortable joke to be telling children. But thankfully, I don't think Shiori gets it, the way she's tilting her head back and forth, like she keeps seeing question marks just out of the corner of her eyes. Clarie remains as expressionless as ever, and I can't tell if that makes the joke better or worse.

                        -cont: Mekuru can't help herself and she turns her ears on more powerfully. Clarie kindly shuts her ears. 'It's ok. you don't have to.'
                        
                        
      
                        -cont: Shiori falls silent and simply puffs up her cheeks while squeezing Yorick to her chest.//...sorry. Said too much. Sometimes my tongue's still sharp. "Oh, Shiori always pouts."
                        -cont: "No, to you. Said too much about your mother.// "I don't care. Say what you want about her."//No. You looked sad.
                        -cont: Mekuru relates to the Infinite Scream. Even right now, she feels like...// I should... go. Be good.//Clarie goes back.
                        -cont: Now Alexa pops up. 
                        -cont: Ahhh! Where do you even come from?! Where were you?
                        -cont: I got lost in a book, she said sadly.




                        ASP-c Kyrie tries to move them out.
                        ASP-c-Hannah oh if i can't handle this, how owuld i ever handle kids? my, do you think it's too ealry to start baby proofing? 
                        ASP-c If you ever want to love someone truly, you must see every side of them, and let them see every side of your own. 
                        ASP-c-Hannah, of course you don't have to stay here and watch me gather my wits. But of course I adore your company.
                        She means it.
                        ASP-c I don't... believe. Weeds... Flowers.

                        i look around. that's... a tall order.

                        mekuru already starts hearing them.  mekuru 3 talks about hearing whispers. 
                        belladonna 1 should make it seem "obvious" who the kaobu are. but then mekuru should get her mind reading powers

It still hurt though..//You're eavesdropping?//Calm down. Breathe in. Stop trying to shut out the ambient noise.
                    -cont: Scene describing Mekuru's hearing improving, whispers in the air, making her shudder.//
                    -cont: I can't believe you're actually making cider from that orchard. You've always been such a pain about it just because you hate apples!
                    -cont: Nick you ugly bastard! Stop stringing her along.
                    -cont: Ahhh... Hana, if only you were my actual daughter!
                    -cont: I'm telling you. There were children. They all disappeared. They would've been your age by now, he growled. 
                    -cont: Ok pops, what about us? They must have thought you were ugly like sin.
                    -cont: They disappeared into the Earth like the Pied Piper!//Last time you said they were whisked away to the ocean, Nick groans. 

            
                    -cont: And how's Nick feel?//Not repulsed. But a little weirded out. When we were toddlers, she babysat us pretty sure. Can't remember too well.
                    -cont: Are you serious? She's a dinosaur.//Clarie frowns. "She was only a teenager. Not that bad age difference."//A teenaged dinosaur.//If you want to know more about her, come with.
