                    <p>"Meru...?" Shiori asks, absolutely confused.</p>

                    <p>"It's okay. Breathe. Don't shut it out. Or it drills in. It's wind. You hear it but you don't hear it."</p>

                    <p>I hear it... but don't hear it. </p>

                    <p class="fading"><em>Okay pops, if all the children got kidnapped then what happened to us? I'm the age they should've been.</em></p>

                    <p>Clarie's voice is... actually really nice. I don't know how I never noticed it. Its presence always paled next to Hannah's grand elocution, or Kyrie's sunniness. Or even my mom's flat firmness. The quiet, consideration in it isn't so ostensible because it's not ostentatious. No one thinks much of someone polite enough to knock softly on the door to your room, but it can mean the world in a stressed out moment.</p>

                    
                    <p class="fading2"><em>They must have thought you were ugly like sin. The ones without a stupid looking mug disappeared into the Earth with the Pied Piper!</em> </p>
                    <p class="fading2"><em>Last time you said they were whisked away to the ocean!</em></p>


                    <p>Her words are asking softly to come in, and something in the quiet vibrations is canceling out the painful ringing. The screaming sun almost fully dies or blends, and the whispers, and the snitches, and everyones' voices... And only when it all fades into the background do I realize how bad I was clenching my jaw -- right where it meets my ears -- and it's like her voice is massaging away some of that soreness.  </p>
                    <p id="tinyquote">e e e e eee ee ee eee eee eeee ee ee e e e eee ee ee eee eee eeee ee ee e e e eee ee ee eee eee eeee ee ee e e e eee ee ee eee eee eeee ee ee e e e eee ee ee eee eee eeee ee e</p>

                    <p>Nature's infinite scream. Whatever it's supposed to be, as it become the normal, shrill background chatter , I start to get the sense that somehow the sound has been with me all my life. Sound... seems to have been with me all my life.</p>

                    <p>"Meru! Are you okay?! Meru!"</p>
                    <p>Shiori is just fretting worriedly like someone lost and despairing in the emergency room, but I wince as I hear her voice come in louder than I think she realizes. </p>

                    <p>You know, thinking about it, it's way too obvious. But the last few days have been so stressful, I'd been putting two and two together, one addition at a time, and I just didn't have the clarity to multiply everything all at once.</p>

                        <p>The families on Rumueri Hill must be descendants, somehow, of the Netabare lineage. Not that I can... exactly put it together. It's all still a little messy. But that's the only way it all fits.</p>

                        <p>"Clarie, do the phrases Kankaku Kazoku or Kaobu Kakei mean anything to you?"</p>

                        <p>She stays silent in response for a while, before responding. "TV Show maybe? Don't watch much TV, Meru. Hurts my ears."</p>

                        <p>Well... that's eminently unhelpful. But it's clear that Clarie... and maybe me... must have the elevated sense of hearing. Was it Keijo Cho? But what would that mean?</p>

                        <p>Is it inherited? Didn't the masked woman say that Shiori had the Keijo Soku? If it is inherited... does that mean... maybe Clarie's my real mother? </p>

                        <p>My head's spinning.</p>

                        <p>"Seems like you're thinking... dumb things. Sorry. No simple way to say it. Don't get carried away. My bad, I told you to keep thinking. But some thoughts... not a great track. Both of us have good hearing. Kin of spirit, not blood." Clarie speaks a little haltingly. </p>

                        <p>"Um... how do you know what I'm thinking?"</p>

                        <p>She flinches a bit.</p>

                        <p>"...I'm just perceptive. Emotionally."</p>

                        <p>Now that's definitely not true.</p>

                        <p>"What are you guys even talking about right now?" Shiori asks. She must feel left out, if not just baffled. </p>

                        <p>Yorick... seems tuned in, actually? I mean, Shiori's doing a restless juggle with him, but somehow it feels like he's listening. Like... maybe I'm catching his eyes darting back and forth between Clarie and me.</p>

                        <p>"We're just talking about if my mom's my real mom." </p>

                        <p>Ouch. I thought I was just saying it straight, but I feel my heart absolutely punch out my chest when I say it. Just this... horrible guilt like maybe she's listening right now. </p>
                        <p>"Meru... stop." </p>

                        <p>Clarie says it firmer and louder than I ever heard her. And it's startling.</p>

                        <p>"O-okay..."</p>

                        <p>I feel my blood rushing to my face somehow, and I just stare at the ground. Just more of me being pulled into the kid role, I guess. But I just feel like... I got caught doing something awful. </p>

                        <p>"Please don't... tell my mom I said that." I say it pretty quietly, feeling stupid all the while.</p>

                        <p>It's not like I was trying to be mean. I was just thinking. It's not like any of this matters, anyway. They're just NPCs... But... Maybe they can feel hurt or something. I just-</p>

                        <p>Shiori steps in close, her face popping up close to mine.</p>
                        
                        <P>"It's okay, Meru." She gives me a comforting smile like she always this, even when she doesn't quite get it. "I know you're just trying your best."</P>

                        <p>"Y-yeah..." I shuffle a bit and look up, and there's Clarie looking guilty and shuffling herself like she just kicked a puppy.</p>

                        <p>Maybe we really are kin of spirit. </p>

                        <p>"I should go." She finally says it after a long awkward silence. "...wasn't trying to be mean. You have a good friend, though. Okay, bye."</p>

                        <p>It almost feels like she tries to get a running start the way she flips around and starts speed walking. But I call out to stop her.</p>
                        
                        <p>"Wait! Clarie... Are you just going to leave us to our devices here?" I ask, a little confused more than anything.</p>

                        <p>Her back's still turned to us. "What harm could kids do? Just make sure not to get kidnapped. That's all. Watch out for Hannah if she comes at you with a rag."</p>

                        <p>...Is that supposed to be a joke? That is an extremely uncomfortable joke to be telling children, and Shiori just nods at the advice as if she got told not to accept candy from strangers. </p>

                        <p>But before she's off to the races once more, she offers some last parting words. "Meru. Soon... if you hear things. Even newer things. You can ask me. Okay? Don't keep it in."</p>

                        <p>Aaaaand she's gone, up the spiral staircase we came in through, speeding past the clerestory. She must have felt subconscious with us still watching her because she starts ducking a bit as if it means anything. </p>

                        <p>"Wow, what a weirdo," Alexa snorts. She looks as smug as ever. "No squealing this time?"</p>

                        <p>Shiori did squeak a little, actually.</p>

                        <p>And her rapid appearance <em>does</em> shock me, but it was almost too rapid this time. I didn't have time to yelp or scream, and I just turn my gaze toward her coolly. She's usually a little annoying, but she must have really come to piss me off today. </p>
                        
                        <p>"Hi, Alexa. Something bad happen? Why are you picking a fight?"</p>
                        
                        <p>"...to me? Never." Her words do feel a little colder today. "I'm just here to guide you, ahem -- slowpokes is a nice way of putting it -- <em>slowpokes</em> because you'd be missing just about every snitch if you kept at your pace. Are you forgetting what you're here for?"</p>

                        <p>She really <em>does</em> go for the sore spots.</p>

                        <p>"Where were you anyway?" I demand. "We've been through a lot of crap while you were gone."</p>

                        <p>"I got lost in a book," Alexa responds sadly.</p>

                        <p>"That happens to me a lot too," Shiori nods.</p>

                        <p>"...Whatever. There's a snitch here?" I ask. </p>

                        <p>"That's what I said, yes."</p>

                        <p>No, seriously, I am this close to hitting her.</p>

                        <p>But I keep it in, and Alexa leads us to the far side of the room, where there's something like a bar tucked in the corner. There's tons of bottles of expensive looking alcohol around. Many have in fact been opened, but somehow I get the sense it's been years since anyone drank any of this.</p>

                        <p>"People are always building Speak Easies they'll never actually use. It's a shame, really." Alexa picks up what looks like a bottle of bourbon to read the labels. She's got the appearance of an older teen so it's almost more inappropiate of a look than if Shiori and I played with it. Erm, I mean, picked it up.</p>

                        <p>Alexa walks over to a register tucked away in a small compartment behind the bar counter. Click. She presses a button to pop it open, and there's the familiar sound of paper moving.</p>

                        <p>"This one sounds kinda... gross." I say. Maybe it's my sensitive hearing, but the way it's moving around under all these receipts reminds me of a worm. </p>

                        <p>And sure enough a snitch comes out of The Codex to cluck and pluck, pecking and the papers till it grabs one which wriggles disgustingly in its clutches.</p>

                        <p>It's an... order sheet? Filled orders for diethyl ether. I don't know what that is, but it sounds pretty heavy.</p>

                        <p>"Ether...?" Shiori ambles around and pokes her curious face in. "It does have alchemical associations... Like quintessence."</p>

                        <p>"Not a bad guess. But nowadays you're more likely to use it to burn a corpse or ruin a sniffing dog's nose."</p>

                        <p>"You're being really unpleasant today," I say the loud thing out loud. </p>

                        <p>"Things are gonna get a lot more unpleasant than me in just a day or two. Or are you two still caught up in pretend?"</p>

                        <p>I've got no comeback. All I can do is anxiously mumble in response, and Shiori takes on that withdrawn and empty look again.</p>

                        <p>I know it's the least important thing right now. But can't she be just... nicer?</p>
                        <p>"Meru. Look at me."</p>
                        <p>I glance up, and there's Alexa staring me straight in the eye. Again, I can't help but notice they're beautiful and somehow pale. Almost... iridescent.</p>

                        <P>"The past was horrible. But the future is more important. This isn't a Haunted House. You're not just here on a <em>ride.</em> What you do from now on <em>does</em> matter. Especially now that the murders are about to start." Alexa takes a deep breath and lets out an even deeper sigh. "Don't let the past drag you into a pit."</P>

                        <p>"U-um, Alexa!" Shiori blurts. "Are you saying that Meru can be saved? For sure? That if we do everything right, we can leave together?"</p>

                        <p>There's light in those eyes again, and she's brimming with something she clearly hasn't had in a while. Hope.</p>

                        <p>And the gut feeling I have that what she's hoping for won't happen fills a tiny, hidden part of me with quiet despair.</p>
                        <p>"...I won't promise anything like that. I'm just telling you to keep your eyes open. Keep looking at what's around you, and don't stop observing."</p>

                        <p>"But what do we have to <em>do?"</em>I ask anxiously.</p>

                        <P>Alexa just rolls her eyes.</P>

                        <p> "Haven't you figured it out by now? If you can't solve that how can you expect to..." She rubs her temple frustratedly. "You have to solve the murders. Okay? You have to find the truth. And if you don't... it's gonna be bad. I'm not gonna spoonfed you any more, because it's not gonna help you one bit if you can't think for yourself."</p>

                        <p>It's annoying because, well, I figured it was something like that. But having  confirmation is completely different than even the most educated speculation.</p>

                        <p>But I guess it's true Shiori and I have been hoping against hope we could avoid that. Then I work up the courage to glance over and... Shiori's trembling as she grips Yorick, but she has a resolute look in her eye. </p>

                        <p>"Okay. We can do it. If that's what it takes." Even Yorick's got a determined look, his little eyes squinting in fierce, slime determination.</p>

                        <p>"...Good. I'll leave you to it then. And read that snitch already, damn." Alexa says.</p>

                        <p>And then she vanishes.</p>

                Father has a lot of axioms. But mother pays the most attention to one. "Consumarre set Coniungi." To complete is <em>to unite.</em> The exemplar of completion, of course, is consummation of marriage.

                <br><br>
                That much is not lost on me. I am the completion of both mother and father, and I'm proud of it. 

                <br><br>
                But it feels rather insidious to me, sometimes. I have a great nose like my mother. When I'm near people, I can understand their potential like a scent. It's like I can smell everything they <em>could</em> be. 
                <br><br>
                Or everything they could be a part of.

                Sometimes I wonder how many go through the world completely unaware of the hint of mythic blood in them. I'm half dryad, so my lineage is apparent to me. But so many of our new citizens who come in, many of them are not even magi. 

                <br><br>
                They come less in search of Sophia, and more for a new start. We promise them things. Sometimes we offer them things. I'm afraid that, perhaps behind my back, my mother and father threaten them with things. 
                <br><br>
                But I'm too small of a person to protect every single person who comes here. If I can protect anyone, it would be the children.

                The children love me, and I love them. They love mother too, and if time could just freeze on one beautiful day everything would be perfect.

                <br><br>
                I feel guilty, knowing there's a deeper meaning to the Magi Games we play. But... maybe it's alright. The children find it thrilling playing Find the Magi.

        <p>I mean... at this point... Isn't this way too obvious?</p>

        <p>"Hannah must be a descendant. I bet she's the nose one. What is it? Keijo Sniffu or something?" I ask.</p>

        <p>But Shiori's biting her lip in thought and consternation. "Meru, I'm telling you. Hannah doesn't have a good sense of smell."</p>

        <p>"She literally <em>sniffs us</em> Shiori."</p>

        <p>"I know, I know!" Shiori lets out her exasperation. "But it's... metaphorical or something! I remember! One time she was right there, cooking, not even smelling everything was completely burned!"</p>

        <p>"Some people are just <em>bad cooks."</em></p>

        <p>"This isn't that," Shiori says impatiently. "I agree. It's suspicious. Both of them seem to be obsessed with consuming extra coy fungi."</p>

        <p>"...Consumarre est coniuingi."</p>

        <p>"That's what I said! I think... maybe she's related. But there's no way that Hannah has the Keijo Ko. Maybe she's just copying a family tick she doesn't actually have? I don't know anything about her parents..." Shiori says thoughtfully.</p>

        <p>Honestly, thinking about it, neither of us seem to know <em>anything</em> about anyone on Rumueri's parents. Sure, I get being dad-less. But I've never heard my mom talk about a grandpa or grandma once.</p>

        <p>...But then again, I realize with a little regret, I don't think I know anything about Shiori's parents either. </p>

        <p>That's when I start hearing the footsteps from far away. Oof. Speak of the devil. That's definitely Hannah talking, and she sounds really out of sorts. In a different way from her usual meltdowns. She sounds physically haggard.</p>

        <P>And she's with Kyrie? Who doesn't sound great herself. </P>

        <p>Shoot. Are we fine being here? Clarie could vouch for us, but I always feel like no one takes her seriously. The only way out is walking past them...</p>

        <p>And as they're walking along the clerestory above, Kyrie calls out in a friendly but concerned tone.</p>

        <p>"Is this where you guys were? Your mom's been looking for you Meru. And... Monika's here too. Looking for Shiori."</p>

        <p>Rather than freezing up like usual, Shiori bleats out a frustrated wail, almost temper-tantrummy. "Right now?!"</p>

        <p>"Sorry," Kyrie says with genuine contrition as she comes round, Hannah quietly mumbling, almost completely leaning on her shoulder. "What are you two even doing here?" </p>

        <p>Oh. She's drunk. Both of them definitely consumed alcohol.</p>

        <p>"We were looking at Hannah's pretting paintings!" Shiori thinks fast.</p>

        <p>Hannah's eyes focus, and she gives a big goofy smile. "Do you like it? Ohh, don't I just capture Nick's handsomeness?"</p>

        <p>"Ahaha... uhuh!" Shiori nods with a cheerful, absolute lie.</p>

        <p>It's amazing, though. Right now Hannah looks absolutely wasted, but her elocution doesn't seem to stutter a bit. If you heard her on the phone you wouldn't even think she was drunk. It's the stumbling and the red shot eyes that tell the tale.</p>

        <p>Kyrie is now fishing through the bar counter's compartments. She must be looking for some kind of hangover cure.</p>

        <p>"Well... that's wonderful that you kids... can appreciate Hannah's art. Her wonderful art. But you'll have to play somewhere else, now. Hannah needs some medicine and some rest."</p>

        <P>"Hmmmm?" Hannah tilts her head with enough curiosity to almost tip all the way to one side like a slow sinking ship. "No, no, no! The children can stay. The children <em>must</em> stay!"</P>

        <p>Clarie's horrible joke about Hannah coming at us with rags pops briefly into my mind.</p>

        <p>"Hannah, you really are not fit to be looking after kids right now."Kyrie looks very concerned as she drops a few aspirins into some seltzer water, and squeezes some lime and honey into it. Oh? And she's making a second glass.</p>

        <p>"Oh Kyrie, how am I ever gonna have kids if I can't handle these two angels?" Hannah lurches to a knock-kneed sit on a gallery bench. "Babies are going to be so much more troublesome, ohh especially with this gigantic house! Do you think it's too early to start baby proofing?"</p>

        <p>Hoo boy. </p>

        <p>"I don't think you could baby proof a house this big," Shiori says with full sincerity.</p>

        <p>"Hmmmmm. Hm hm hm! Why, Shiori, I think you are absolutely right! Nick and I are going to have to move, aren't we? This manor really is no place for children..." Hannah mulls it over very, very seriously, while sipping the hangover cure Kyrie made for her. </p>

        <p>You know, besides the aspirins, that actually looks kinda good...</p>

        <p>"I'm really not sure this is appropriate," Kyrie says, looking a good bit more stressed than I'd ever seen her.</p>

        <p>"Kyrie," Hannah starts with a tone of absolute wisdom. "If you ever want to love someone truly, you must see every side of them and let them see every side of you. Now, we all love Meru and Shiori, don't we?"</p>

        <p>Kyrie sighs. "Of course we do."</p>

        <p>O-oh. Really...?</p>

        <p>"Sit children! The wonderful scent of you is making me clear and bright already. Oh, alcohol is such an awful thing isn't it? What a fool I was..." Hannah motions to either side of her on the gallery bench.</p>

        <p>It's... we're falling back into our pattern. But I guess we don't have much choice. Or do we? Could we just go sprinting out right now?</p>

        <p>But I look at Hannah's enchanted eyes, and squirrely smile. Whatever her hangups... she genuinely loves children. And I try my best to keep the thought way back in my head, back of the shelf, back of the freezer even: that she'd never get the chance to have them...</p>

        <p>"Miss Hannah, how come you don't take care of the plants?" Shiori asks. I wince. Maybe I'm crazy, but that feels like it'd be a sore question for Hannah.</p>

        <p>But she ponders it very seriously. Doesn't even seem very surprised by it.</p>

        <P>"Ohh, Lessie bothers me about the same thing, you know. They wonder why I let the weeds thrive. This place used to have such gorgeous flower fields, you see? Just beautiful and trimmed and manicured... like it had a lavish salon visit every day." Hannah speaks softly and thoughtfully. I guess real talk sobers people up.</P>

        <P>"But I... I didn't like it. I don't like... choosing things to live," Hannah continues. "Who ever said it was wrong to be a weed? They're just trying to survive like everything else. 
        
        Crecer means to let grow, to nurture, did you know? They already live such short lives, plants... A single spring, or a year if they're lucky. Shouldn't they be allowed to try their best to live and grow and die like the rest of us?"</p> 
        
        <p>"Oh, goodness," she sighs. "I must sound so silly."</P>

        <p>Not silly, no. But... a little idealistic, maybe.</p>

        <P>"But Miss Hannah, if you don't get rid of weeds then the other plants die," Shiori says, puzzlement clear.</P>

        <p>"...Yes. You're right. I'm just being a coward of sorts, aren't I?" Hannah says softly, sounding like she's talking to herself more than anyone. </p>

        <p>That's when I notice it. A handkerchief Hannah seems to be breathing from. Ugh, Clarie's stupid rag joke keeps coming back! But Hannah's the one breathing it. I hadn't put much thought into it because I thought she was just nauseous from drinking.</p>

        <p> But the way she's clutching it now has more of the feel of a security blanket. Lavender colored, with lavender fields embroidered on it, the small cloth's a clear plea for tranquility.</p>

        <p>And looking at Kyrie, she seems a little upset seeing it.</p>

        <p>"Alright, you two. Let's let Hannah get some rest. I'm not exactly spry like a spring chicken right now either." Kyrie ushers us to the stairs out. "Shiori... I saw Monika skulking around the rest wing. You can do what you want with that information." </p>

        <p>"I'm gonna hide from her!" Shiori chirps. </p>

        <p>"Well, then you better start hiding." Kyrie sends us off with a wink.</p>

        <p>Am I the only one who finds it weird that Monika's walking through the rest wing? She's not exactly a guest if she's just here to get Shiori. If it were me, I'd feel awkward going around bedrooms, even if I <em>was</em> just looking for someone. Am I just too polite?</p>

        <p>The rest of the party, Shiori and I turned the whole place over. I wasn't sure if we were playing hide and seek with Monika, or if we were looking for snitches, but we didn't run into any more. Or Monika, for that manner.</p>

        <p>Monika had come and gone without even picking her up.</p>

        <p>No one seemed upset with that outcome -- especially not Shiori -- but it was definitely a puzzler. If you went to pick up a kid from a slumber party, and then all you did was walk through someone else's house without even taking the kid -- I mean, isn't that just trespassing?</p>

        <p>We figured it was just another ugly display of self-absorption and irresponsibility from a woman known for it. It worked out for us, definitely, who didn't have much in the way of contingency plans if Shiori <em> did</em> get snatched away.</p>

        <p>But none of us expected that Monika wouldn't show up the next day, either. Or the day after that. Or that when anyone finally checked to see where the woman-child was, she'd just left a note at her kitchen counter saying she skipped town.</p>
