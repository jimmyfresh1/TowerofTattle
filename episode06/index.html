<p>            "Well hell," Al says, rubbing the back of his neck. "I sure ran my mouth there, didn't I? Boy, I'd look even worse of an old fool than usual if I said all that, then just let you two run around town alone after getting on her case..."</p>

<p>            Al strokes his beard thoughtfully while Shiori and I stare up at him. Are we about to be chaperoned? Can we really afford to do that? My mind's swimming, trying to figure out what the best course of action is, but it seems like I'm always on the verge of forgetting what we're trying to achieve.</p>

<p>            Calm down. Think it through. All we're really doing is looking for my specific diary entries. For whatever reason, we're getting all kinds of <em>other</em> diaries, from other people. Including Shiori. Including some mysterious "Girl X." Then we have The Codex Sussurokawa talking about destiny. Or at least, Alexa, who's like some fairy of The Codex, keeps talking about destiny. The way she pointed out my blanked out name, it feels like if we follow her lead, we'll get the rest of it. </p>

<p>            On that note, the "NPCs" we talk to seem to respond to how much of my identity I've managed to reclaim. I'm pretty sure I heard Al call me M, and I don't <em>think</em> there was any way he could have heard Shiori give me that nickname. It's almost like this entire weird fake town is <em>set up</em> for me to relive the past, remember my memories, and reclaim my name as a function of those first two things. </p>

<p>            I take a furtive sidelook at Shiori, who's sort of rocking back and forth on her heels like an excited kid. She's not losing her sense of identity... she definitely remembers who she is, why she's here, and the fact that she's not actually twelve. But she's also definitely getting hard pulled into the role.</p>

<p>            "Tell you what, Miss Shiori, Miss M. Why don't you both accompany me to my abode, and you can play around there while I take a nap before the magic show?" Al says.</p>

<p>
                "It's a ritual!" Shiori chides him.
    
</p>
<p>            "Of course," he winks. "Now, come on. Follow me. I'll try to not to walk an old man pace, so just scamper behind and don't wander off."</p>

<p>            Al sets off down the stairs actually... at quite the decent march. He's spry, that old man, and maybe not that aware of how slow short-legged kids actually are, even if they're bounding with energy. Shiori seems to pale for a moment thinking about taking another long walk, but gives Yorick a small squeeze for self-assurance before she, in fact, starts scampering after.</p>

<p>            "Come on, M! We don't wanna get left behind!" Shiori says.</p>

<p>            "Shiori," I say, "you remember why we're here, right?"</p>

<p>            For a second she looks surprised. But she sort of squirms back and forth impatiently. "I do! Of course, I do. But I also really wanna see this magic show for some reason! Come on! And we'll probably find some more telltail snitches at The Creepy Peach!" And off she goes, bounding down the stairs after Al.</p>

<p>            The what now?</p>

            <hr>

<p>
                It only took about five minutes of follow the oblivious leader before we had to beg Al to slow down a bit. Or, Shiori had to beg I mean. I probably could've kept up with it. Yeah. But anyway, we asked him to slow down, and the old man seemed genuinely surprised by it. But he just stroked his beard a bit, and decided he'd "go his old man pace, after all."
    
</p>
<p>            So now he's just humming what sounds like sea shanties to himself while taking a leisurely stroll just ahead of us, making sure to take a glance back and forth every so often; then when he sees the two of us, he smiles a bit, and turns around and goes on humming. </p>

<p>
                I like Al. I feel protected around him. I must of liked him in the past too, because it's a familiar feeling. 
    
</p>
<p>
                "Shiori," I whisper. "What's The Creepy Peach?"
    
</p>
<p>
                "It's where Al and Hana live," she whispers back. "Their house is really close to yours! It's "The Creepy Peach" because it's kinda yellow and pink, and rote, rotat... roter-" 
    
</p>            
<p>            "Rotund?" I suggest.</p>
            
<p>
                "Yeah! It's rotund but it's got a really spiky black fence that's really creepy! And it's in, um, it's all netted up with metal, like, so the vines can grow on it, it's um..." Shiori struggles.
    
</p>            
<p>
                "Espaliered?" I suggest again.
    
</p>
<p>
                "Maybe! Why do you know so many big words now?" Shiori asks, a bit struck, with maybe a bit of envy creeping into her face.
    
</p>
<p>
                I don't know, actually. This feels like a new thing. I definitely felt like I was getting smarter the closer I got to The Heart of Waechner's Vault -- like all the secrets of the world were trying to find their way into my head, and I was a vessel prepared to understand them. Or something. And now that we're just in The Heart itself, soaking it all up...
    
</p>
<p>
                "Stop looking so smug," Shiori huffs.
    
</p>
<p>
                "I am not," I say.
    
</p>
<p>
                "You are." Shiori keeps acting childish. Even Yorick seems to notice, the way his gray slime eyes strain and stress a bit, asking for understanding, apologizing for her. Don't worry Yorick. I get it. Wait, he's giving Shiori that look, too? What am I doing, wrong?
    
</p>
<p>            The timber-lined path slopes gently downward and to the right. It's an almost racetrack like curve it's so gentle, except it goes downhill. But as we traverse it, down, and down, and down, I see more and more flowers. Scattered bushes of fluffy white hydrangeas. Little tufts of golden rayed lilies here and there, scratchy and patchwork like a someone did a bad job shaving. Snowdrops assembling in little crowds, big enough that it feels like they <em>want</em> to be called fields, but it's just not quite so. And everywhere, every color of evening primrose growing tall and keeping the other plants in check.</p>

<p>            But it's not just flowers. There's all kinds of weeds you'd usually kill. There's ugly crabgrass everywhere. We're still in a clearing, so this place was obviously <em>cleared</em> at some point, and probably had beautiful fields and bushes that were carefully arranged. And at some point, the maintenance must have just stopped all together. </p>

<p>    Just like Shiori said, at the end of a path of lower cut grass through the field, there's a rotund, yellow-pink building with a creepy black fence, and creepy metal espaliering. It really does look like a peach in a metal fruit net. It's huge, too. Whoever designed this must have thought it would look cute, but it's more unsettling than anything.</p>

<p>"Now, you kids will be juuust fine playing here. Hannah should be home, and she can watch you two," Al says.</p>

<p>Hannah? I'm pretty sure that was another one of the murder victims. What exactly is the relation between Al and Hannah? Now that I'm thinking about it, for a guy who looks like he's been doing blue collar work all his life, this sure is a big and fancy house. The kind of fancy-ugly that only someone really rich could afford.</p>

<p>"This is Hannah's house," Shiori whispers to me. "Al's like... a handyman around Rumeuri. Al says he lives with Hannah because Hannah takes care of him, but... it's kinda the other way around. At least that's what everyone says."</p>

<p>I <em>think</em> I'm catching what Shiori's saying. Fair enough, but who is 'everyone', exactly?
</p>

<p>"Hannah!" Al calls out. "Hannah, are you in there dear? I've got Miss Shiori and Miss M here!" </p>
