        I think I would've felt better if Shiori had been crying.
        
</p>
<p>Instead, she's just been silent for a good long while, the two of us silently eating outside by the town hall. It makes me kinda squeamish, but we're sitting on the raised steps the altar's placed on because it's the closest thing to a bench that's right here. </p>

<p>We've been sitting here forever while the adults settle things inside. So, we decided to go ahead and eat.</p>

<p>In my head I'd sort of imagined this to be a little happier of a moment. I would've looked over at Shiori and said 'Is it really alright to eat this?' And her eyes would glitter and she'd say 'Free food!' But instead it's been a sad silence, and my heart hurts. The only sound is crickets and the buzz of a sodium streetlight.</p>
<p>
        
        The interesting thing is that Nick had left us a little note, saying 'Go ahead and take the all sandwiches,' which... never really was in question. But at least we have his permission after we did it. The surprise was that the note turned into a snitch. This one folded itself into a fish, and started swimming through the air. Bad move, because almost immediately a swarm of the other snitches came out as birds and pecked at it madly, before taking their pray back to The Codex.

<p>Honestly? I didn't have much to say to this one. It's not exactly a surprise that magi would be long-lived, maybe even immortal, or at least try to be. </p>

<p>Shiori had stayed stone silent when she saw it. Still lost in thought.</p>

<p>"...Why didn't I remember?" Shiori says, finally.</p>

<p>"I don't think you should beat yourself up over it," I try to comfort her. "Maybe you forced yourself to forget because it was traumatic."</p>

<p>"I-it was traumatic. But that really doesn't make sense... Did you notice, Mu? She... The masked woman called out the murders. A-Al was the first to die. No, even more than that... The murders have been outlined here the whole time."</p>

<p>Shiori points a shaky finger at the tablet, though the way her arm stays close and hugged to herself, it's like she's afraid to even stretch it out and offend the air.</p>

<p>"The murders... matched the tablet. Al died first. The week before he died, he went blind. Hannah... died of ap-aphasia...? Dyslexia..."</p>

<p>"Um, asphyxia?"</p>

<p>"Y-yeah. She... Hannah suffocated." Shiori says quietly. "And the rest of them too..."</p>

<p>We're both silent for a second, and I feel the dread start to sink into the pit of my stomach. It's been hanging in the air, the fear that maybe we'd have to re-experience something awful. And so we didn't talk about the murders. They were the elephant in the room that had been brutalized and chopped into pieces. Try ignoring that, huh?</p>

<p>I'd... probably been hoping, just like Shiori, that this relive the past, rollercoaster experience would end before the bad stuff. But I guess that's like a kid hoping the coaster car never drops. The second we saw the date, we should've known there was no way to avoid the past.</p>

<p>But Shiori... no...  not just her. I didn't want to face it. But now we have to. </p>

<p>"There's only one reason someone would declare their murders ahead of time. O-or, at least that I can think of, from the perspective of a magus..." Shiori stutters. "I might just be grasping at straws."</p>

<p>Below the sadness and fear, I can hear something else in her voice. For some reason... there's an unmistakeable desperation underneath. But why?</p>

<p>"Well, what is it?"</p>

<p>"Sacrifice rituals are... a common way to generate mana. R-ritualistic death is one of the most reliable sources there is. And if you tell people they're going to die, and tell them how... and they can't stop it, anyway. I-it's kinda like Mahjong. You get more points. You squeeze more mana out of the universe." Shiori says.</p>

<p>Huh? That really doesn't make sense to me.</p>

<p>"Who? Who's giving the points out? Why would that happen?"</p>

<p>"N-nobody knows!" Shiori stammers. "Mystery is intrinsic to the power of magi. It's just a property of mana that there's... an implicit observer. There's something... a perspective that reads the symbols you've crafted, and recognizes the efforts of those magi who have a sense of literary flour..."</p>

<p>"Flourish."</p>

<p>"Yeah, flourish."</p>

<p>"So, whoever murdered everyone was... writing some kind of magical story?" I say, still trying to grasp it.</p>

<p>"K-kind of. It's like... the better you are at keeping secrets, the more powerful it gets. Like a magic t-trick! Where the more p-people you fool, the more dangl ..frazzled ...dazzled the audience gets."</p>

<p>I tilt my head and close my eyes, feeling a headache coming on. "Someone's trying to impress us with a big magic trick."</p>

<p>"It m-might be more correct to say... they're mocking us," Shiori says her voice just a weak mumble now. "I-it's like a grand prank... The more elaborate and grand, the more mana bestowed."

        <p>"And that makes us..."</p>

        <p>"... the punchline." </p>

        <p>"That's awful." What can I even do? I just stare up at the air, trying to process it all. I don't even know if I have any anger left in me today.</p>

        <p> I've got plenty of fear left, though, and the chills I'm feeling aren't just from the cold air. But in a way I already knew. I felt it before I went into the town hall. There's someone... something out there just laughing at our misery. And the more misery it heaps on, the more mana it gets.</p>

        <p>Or got. Now that I think about it. Because it's clear they'd already won, so many years ago, when Shiori and I were actually kids.</p>

        <p>If there's anything I'm feeling right now, it's my emotions quietly dying. It's something that already started when I got closer to The Heart. But now that I know the only way I'll get through all this... the only way I can get Shiori through this is to just let it happen. Let them die. Just... let them decay and rot away, like they were meant to.</p>

        <p>Al? He's going to die. Hannah? Her too. And Nick. And three more people I don't even remember, who once upon a time might've been oases in my life. </p>

        <p>My mother? It's time for me to stop playing pretend. She... she's not here. She (probably disappeared with the rest of the town.</p>

        <p>At the end of the day, this 'town' is just a walking corpse. This dream we've been living is just a nightmare waiting for the chance to grab us and swallow us whole. And... for Shiori's sake, one of us has to make sure that doesn't happen. </p>

        <p>Speak of the devil, one of those yet unmet murder victims is walking toward us right now. It isn't until I see her authentic and concerned face that I remember her: Kyrie Stodakis.</p>

        <hr>

        <p>Someone who really cares. That's the first phrase that echoes through my memory when I see her. </p>

        <p>I'd idly seen her talking to members of the congregation, seemingly seeing if <em>they</em> were alright too. It rubbed me the wrong way at first, and I kept thinking, "Them? Why bother with them?"</p>

        <p>But she works some kind of magic of patience and tenderness, because more than a few congregation members seemed to break down into tears. Maybe they felt sorry for what they did. Maybe they were more like bystanders caught up in it all. All the while, though, even as she's taking care of people I see her jotting away on a notepad. </p>

        <p>She's got jet black hair, which somehow pairs perfectly and horribly at the same time with her yellow sundress. </p>

        <p>"Shiori... Mu." Kyrie gets down on one knee so she's eye to eye with us. "Are you okay?"</p>

        <p>"I'm fine," I say listlessly.</p>

        <p>Shiori just nods without saying a word.</p>

        <p>"Shiori." Kyrie raises her hand gently near Shiori's face, but doesn't quite touch. As if she's asking for implicit permission.  </p>

        <p>"No... I'm not okay." Shiori says quietly, just stepping into a hug, accepting Kyrie softly stroking her hair.</p>

        <p>I sigh in relief internally. Right now, where her mental state is... Shiori needs the support of an adult. And she seems to trust Kyrie a lot.</p>

        <p>"I'm sorry it took me so long to get to you two. I kept thinking and thinking about both you kids, but I just..." She hesitates.</p>

        <p>"Are you investigating something Kyrie?" I ask the quiet thing out loud. And her eyes seem to shake a bit.</p>

        <p>"Mu, why are you asking that? Did someone in that congregation say something to you?" She sounds alarmed.</p>

        <p>"No, but... I saw you taking notes," I say honestly. "It's weird. Everyone there was weird. They weren't normal."</p>

        <p>I'm trying my best to frame my inquiry as just a kid's uncanny intuition. I realize I'm never going to learn anything about this town if I don't just straight up ask.</p>

        <p>"There's a lot going on in this town," Kyrie says uncomfortably. "It's not something you kids need to worry about."</p>

        <p>"Kyrie. Did children go missing from this town?" I ask.</p>

        <p>"Mu." </p>
        
        <p>This time Kyrie looks me in the eye. Her hand hovers next to my face now. Without realizing it, I lean into her hand just like Shiori did. Her hand actually feels cool against my face.</p>

        <p>I thought her eyes were as dark as her hair, but looking at them close I realize they're actually brown. Somehow in the orange, sodium light, they look like coals lit up into embers.</p>

        <p>"Sometimes smart precocious kids take on more than they should," she says, haltingly. "And sometimes... they try to do something beyond their capability. As a coping mechanism for fear."</p>

        <p>"I'm not doing that."</p>

        <p>"I didn't say you were. But I want you to ask yourself honestly if you are, okay? I know that... adults seem like we just push you kids around wherever we want." She speaks with a cadence that's measured but soft. </p>

        <p>I blink a bit, feeling awkward at how candid she's being while looking right at me. But I stay quiet while she keeps talking.</p>
                
        <p>"I want you to trust me," she says. "So, I'll answer your question. There's no proof that any children ever went missing from this town. I've tried to look into it myself. But the perception... of missing children. It's so pervasive. So many of my patients believe it. Some of my friends believe it. People who I've never thought of as delusional. But I've never, ever found any proof of missing children." </p>

        <p>"Then how can so many people believe it?"</p>

        <p>"I don't know." She says honestly. "There's been cases in history of mass delusion. Like people who dance themselves to death in a hysterical crowd. Or even people who go to watch a hypnotist and all convince themselves that they're being controlled." </p>

        <p>She gestures backward to the town hall as if to say "You've seen how crazy people get."</p>

        <p>"Is that what you think this is?" I ask.</p>

        <p>"...I don't know." She sighs and pulls me and the silent Shiori into a hug. "That's enough of that conversation. Your mom's just about finished in there. You two need to go home and get some rest. I'll come talk to both of you tomorrow, okay?"  </p>

        <p>"...Okay."</p>

        <p>"Yeah. See you tomorrow."</p>

        <p>Almost like they were cued in by Kyrie herself, my mom, Al, and the officer walk out of the building and toward us. Kyrie pulls the officer aside and says a few words to him, before waving to us and setting off for her own home.</p>

        <p>"Let's go home," my mom sighs. </p>

        <p>"Are we walking all the way back?" I ask. Suddenly I feel exhausted at the prospect.</p>

        <p>"No," my mom says pointing at the police cruiser parked up on the cobblestone. "We'll be riding that.</p>
