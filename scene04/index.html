        <div class="main">
    <p>My... mother?</p>

    <p>I freeze. I don't even know what to think. I don't know what to say. All I can do is dumbly walk out and stare, while Shiori leads me worriedly through the brush.</p>

    <p>"Now we know they're NPCs," Shiori whispered.</p>

    <p>She doesn't <em>look</em> like an NPC. And if she was one, then why would we whisper? She's there, flesh and blood, and even picking a burr off her skirt.</p>

    <p>And she's staring back at us. With the slightest look of surprise, fingers to parted lips, and a sudden stiffness in her posture and widening eyes. Almost like she's...</p>

    <p>"I can't believe you! Look at you two!"</p>

    <p>Furious at how dirty we are?</p>

    <p>She comes over and starts picking at us. As if that's gonna do any good. We're more brush and thicket than we are kids right now. Was she ever a worrywart like this? I find myself unconsciously straightening out my dress, and brushing away her fussing hand.</p>

    <p>She scowls at me. But it feels kind of nice. And that scares me a bit.</p>

    <p>"We were just outside playing," I say, like it was the most normal thing in the world.</p>

    <p>"'Outside playing' my foot!" she snaps. "You didn't come home last night! You ran away from home again and you even made Shiori come with you! Look at her!"</p>

    <p>Shiori just awkwardly smiles and raises her hand hello.</p>

    <p>"Go back home and wash up! Now!"</p>

    <p>Yeah, right. Something about the way she yells like she knows what's going on really pisses me off. And I feel blood rushing to my face. But it's maddening because how can I even say, "You're lecturing and yelling at us and you're not even real! You're basically a robot!" It's like, am I mad at her because she's an NPC who thinks she's people? </p>

    <p> "We were going there, anyway!" I snap back. "Why... why aren't you coming with us?" The angrier I act, the more it'll hide my trembling voice. </p>

    <p>She just stares for a second. Unsure what to say. I feel like I've seen this a million times. Because that moment of consideration she gives turns into "her usual" stoic face that now I know I've seen a million times. And it comes right back to me. She's gonna say...</p>

    <p>"I'm busy... You know that." She says it as nicely as possible. "Go wash up. I have something to care care of."</p>

    <p>"Fine!"</p>

    <p>There's petulant emotions at the surface. But there's darker emotions underneath. The angry face is the fake one, it's covering me up right now. And I break eye contact. I feel stupid for getting my hopes up.</p>

    <p>Because she's always like this. But then... it's not even her. And in a weird way, feeling angry and let down feels happier than realizing anything between me and her, any interaction at all, means nothing at all.</p>

    <p>"Umm..." Shiori tugs at my sleeve softly. "She's not real, Me-... It's okay."</p>

    <p>Of course, my mom just raises her eyebrow at the two of us.</p>

    <p>"They can have complicated behaviors, of course," Shiori continues, "but look! Woman. Go about your business! BLEH!"</p>

    <p>And of course she goes right up to my mom and makes a stupid face with her tongue sticking out at her. I mean... it's true she wouldn't have done that back in the day. But it's also true that that right now my NPC of a mother is scowling and pulling apart Shiori's cheeks. </p>

    <p>"What are you doing?" my mom asks. </p>

    <p>"Whaah ihh sehh dooin-?!" Shiori asks, deep in regret, question marks popping around her head. </p>

    <p>"She just learned a dumb joke," I say, slapping my mom's hands away -- and she raises her eyebrow at me again. Shiori just tries to rub her cheeks with her free hand. "I guess that counts as a complicated behavior. Let's go," I say.</p>

    <p>"Defiant this morning, huh? I'll let it slide. Now go. Wash. Up."</p>

    <p>She doesn't need to tell me again. I don't even look back as I lead Shiori up the sloping path, to my house I suddenly remember.</p>

    <p>This must be what this Tower's all about, picking at the rotting corpse of your memories like a mnemonic vulture, down to the fickle weather. Because a light rain starts falling, leaving a familiar scent and <em> feel</em> in the air, because it has<em>that specific</em> humidity, the kind every place has but never shares, that feeling in the air that tells you you're there and nowhere else in the world. </p>

    <p>But of course we aren't. We're in a place called Waechner's Vault, and we're in The Heart. It's only appropriate that it does everything it can to squeeze mine.</p>

    <p>And so the air keeps drizzling, never quite turning to a real rain, preferring to stay mostly as a fine mist. With only a few errant raindrops running into us, as if they lost their way.</p>

    <hr>

    <p>I'm a little mad that she'd take credit for it, but yes, we did clean up. We didn't take a nap because somehow that feels like it would be giving in, doing something that childish. And like maybe she'd <em>come back</em> while we were sleeping, and I don't even know how I'd deal with that. I don't know what she can and can't do. What's preprogrammed into her behaviors?</p>

    <p>"I can't believe how realistic they are!" Shiori gushes, recently the victim of realism. "It's just like the real thing! With how ore--orenar--oreonerous...</p>

    <p>"Onerous and ornery?" I spit out, though <em>not at Shiori</em> of course. "Yeah. That Waechner guy sure does a great job of capturing all of someone's annoying traits."</p>

    <p>"Yeah..." Shiori says thoughtfully. "Is this really his work...?"</p>

    <p>"I'm sure he just outsourced it to some robot-making magus. I bet there's a ton of those."</p>

    <p>"Hmm... I mean, there definitely <em>are</em> those guys." Shiori keeps mulling it over.</p>

    <p>It's amazing how much better your thinking gets when you're clean. When you're dirty you lose the lucidity to even notice you're losing it. Same goes with sleep though, and I really do feel tired...</p>

    <p>But it's fine. We said we were gonna look for my diary, so let's do that.</p>

    <p>Where do we start?</p>

    <p>Here's my room. It's less exciting for me than I would have hoped. I get the feeling I didn't spend much time in here. I feel a little distant from it, but a <em>familiar</em> distant I had my whole life. No book shelf. A few wooden dolls -- what are we, Victorian? A bed with a really fancy duvet that feels absolutely too starchy.</p>

    <p>Wow. I had a walk-in closet.</p>

    <p>"Check underneath your mattress!" Shiori suggests.</p>

    <p>"No," I mull, "I wouldn't be that obvious."</p>

    <p>"Just check it!</p>

    <p>"It's me we're predicting, and I'm telling you I wouldn't put it there. Maybe there's a loose floorboard somewhere? At least a box in the closet... Look, I'm just gonna ask again. Are you sure I kept a diary?" I ask.</p>

    <p>"Of course you kept one. I <em>know</em> you kept one.</p>

    <p>"Did you ever see it?"</p>

    <p>"No... but you definitely would've kept one. You were that kind of moody girl."</p>

    <p>Ugh. I really hate hearing that, and learning that about myself makes me feel all kinds of unpleasant. Which... tracks.</p>

    <p>"You always had an angsty relationship with your mom," Shiori continues. "'Cause she was so busy as the vicereine."</p>

    <p>"The what now?"</p>

    <p>"She was the town vicereine. It's like the female version of viceroy. Erm. But she was basically just a mayor. It's just one of this town's historical things.</p>

    <p>Not Victorian, apparently, but colonial. Alright. That one was a bit of a curveball.</p>

    <p>"Well, I could've put together that my mom and I don't get along," I say. "But I guess I'm surprised to hear she was that important."</p>

    <p>"Oh yeah! The MOST important," Shiori says.</p>

    <p>For a second, I feel guilt about our fight about how busy she was. But I don't have time for that right now. But that doesn't stop it from messing my thinking up just enough to make this diary-finding problem harder. I've turned into a real <em>do'er</em> since coming back to town, and I really want to keep that streak going. </p>

    <p>Shiori, for her part, has become a lot more passive. Something visually reinforced by the way she always carries Yorick around like a teddy bear. Maybe this was our dynamic as kids. Before whatever happened.</p>

    <p>My thoughts are interrupted by the sound of the Codex rustling. The telltail snitch inside can't exactly coo, so all it can do is rub paper together, and crumple as loudly as possible, and flap against air, which, actually, is way louder than you'd think.</p>

    <p>So, I whip the thing open, and it flies out straight to my mattress. Oh.</p>

    <p>"I told you!"</p>

    <p>"M-maybe it just noticed some loose quarters," I say, lifting up the mattress because the thing was incessantly pecking around my headboard.</p>

    <p>And sure enough, there's a diary, which we frankly don't even know if it was placed by me. After all, when I open it up, a new telltail snitch pulls itself out from the seam and starts flapping its wings excitedly, ready to hop out and do its little nesting ritual with the Codex. Which it does. And that <em>definitely</em> didn't happen when I was a kid.</p>

    <p>A little dazed by how fast we found it, I feel some butterflies in my stomach. But, when I look at it I realize..."

        <P class="quote"> M _/_/_/_/_/_/_"
        </P>

        <p>"It only gave you the first letter of your name..." Shiori says quietly.</p> 

       <p>I'm disappointed too. But she looks absolutely crushed. So, I try to be quick on my feet and cheer her up.</p>

        <p>"Well, that... means the rest of them must be somewhere around this town, right?" I say. "It looks like it gave us a journal entry, too. Here, let's check out whatever nutty thing I wrote as a kid.</p>

        <p>So, I open up the page...</p>

                You know diary, I noticed our house is really big.

                The biggest one in town. My mom said good girls don't brag, so I won't. But how is it our house is so big on a single mother's income? I know all about economics, so I know that doesn't make sense. I've been thinking about why mom will never tell me about daddy. Mom must have done something bad, or be protecting him. I think that maybe he was a wayward princ-
