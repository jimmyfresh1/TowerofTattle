                        <p>Things fall apart fast. When you're stubbornly wearing those old shoes, driving that old car, or even just trying to keep people together, it always breaks down right before you expect it.</p>

                        <p>You'd think that you wouldn't be surprised by when it finally happens. A weird noise makes you pull over. A weird smell makes you look inside the bottle. But somehow you think it'll last a little longer. When it finally comes, somehow you just won't hear it -- even when it sneaks up right behind you.</p>
        
                        <p>Rumeuri fell apart fast. Just like old shoes... old cars... the old town tore at the seams. The engine smoked out. Everyone got sick. Last time I visited town with Shiori, the baker with the huge arms didn't show up to bake because he couldn't even knead the bread. </p>
                        
                        <p> And it started to feel like Nick was right when he said everything that made the town a little nuts must be in the mist. Because as misty days turned into rainy days, and rainy days turned into stormy days, people seemed to get just as crazy as the air was wet. The cult stopped meeting because the masked woman was nowhere to be found, but the followers never disappeared. I could feel their stares on Shiori... and even me. </p>
