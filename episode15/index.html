                <p>"Oh! Yorick likes black licorice!" Shiori says in a happy little whisper.</p>

                <p>"Well... somebody has to, I guess." I hate black licorice.</p>

                <p>"It almost looks like cannibalism," Shiori says. She sounds weirdly... gleeful about it. But I don't think Yorick cares. He finds the black licorice delicious.</p>

                <p>We're hanging out in Nick's candy store right now. Actually, to be more precise, we're at a short bar stool counter at the corner of the candy store, itself a little corner of the Nick's larger boutique. That's right. Even in this small town of Sussurokawa, somehow Nick runs an upscale, swanky establishment that manages to bring in outsiders. If Clarie ran the inn well, we might even have a thriving tourism industry. Unfortunately, she doesn't -- and so at best Sussurokawa Cove is a day trip, an isolated but cozy town hidden across the mountains, idling away on a misty shore.</p>

                <p>Frankly, I'm not sure how he gets enough for his business to thrive. I'd be tempted to say he's just got a vast store of personal wealth that just makes it a mildly unprofitable hobby. And yet Nick is always running around doing work when he's not getting hounded by Al, or... Hannah. </p>
                
                <p>I think that's why he's the only one my mom seems to respect. Kyrie works hard, too. But I don't know if my mom believes in psychologists. </p>

                <p>At any rate, here we are, chomping down on candy, legs swinging at a marble counter, the whole vibe perfectly tailored to let children roleplay like they're at a fancy bar. There's even an old timey soda fountain, with brass spigots for the seltzer and syrups. And you know what? It works. I like it. I wasn't exactly jealous of the Speakeasy from yesterday, but now I see the appeal.</p>
                
                <p>"Ouch! That one feels like electricity..." Shiori squeaks and rubs her cheek.</p>

                <p>"This one's cold... then hot again. And now it's cold again. It tastes like vanilla." I roll the candy around in my mouth.</p>

                <p>Nick's definitely got talent as a candymaker. There's seriously almost something magical them. Or... maybe they're actually magical? There must be a Keijo <em>Tongue</em>, right?</p>

                <p>"What would the tongue version be? For the 'sense clan.'" I ask Shiori.</p>

                <p>"Ummmm," she thinks and jots down in a notebook she's been carrying around ever since we talked to Alexa. "Something like this, probably. Keijo Mi 'çµŒå¸¸å‘³'? "</p>

                <p>What are the chances Nick <em>isn't</em> that, right? It just supports the idea everyone on Rumeuri's a descendant. Because the name of the author of the secret recipe book was...</p>

                <p>"Maya," Shiori says thoughtfully. "You're probably right about Rumeuri... Especially if adopting talented children into families is part of the MO. It just feels like something's off."</p>

                <p>She jots some more in her notebook.</p>

<p>                As a magus, Shiori's been on the ball. Once she knew we <em>had</em> to solve the murders, she found a whole new level of clarity. It's something else, just how much notebook she can fill up in one day. Miles of it, it feels like. Notes on cases, detailed bios of magus lineages, allusions to magi history, magic circles and formulas... </p>

                <p>It's daunting, to say the least.</p>

                <p>"Let's go over what we know. One. This place is probably related to the Netabares. Two, everyone on Rumeuri is probably <em>literally</em> related to the Netabares." Shiori sticks up her fingers one by one, pure didacticism."It's not strange for magic lineage to branch off and dilute. But the trick here is that the Netabares must have been watching this place as a cultivation grounds." </p>

                <p>"Right. I know that's what I said, but isn't it weird? It's like spying on your cousins. And then kidnapping their children. I get that it's magi, but... Is that really efficient?" I ask.</p>

                <p>"Magecraft is built on mystery. The mystery of reality and existence is the traditional source of power, but... Secrets are another kind of mystery. They're not merely lesser to true ontological mysteries, because their human element gives them a unique character. The first great mystery is the mystery of existence. The second great mystery is the mystery of the soul," Shiori says.</p>

                <p>"Sooo..." I tilt my head.</p>

                <p>"So, one route to great power is by actively cultivating ignorance. Think about it. Magecraft becomes weaker and weaker as humans reveal the mysteries of the world. What's the one way to ensure your magic stays powerful together?"</p>

                <p>"...Make sure there's always someone who doesn't know any better?"</p>

                <p>"Exactly," Shiori says."And in this case, the reversed flow would be even stronger if they're of magic lineage. Like... like breeding livestock over generations and generations. They'd be rich in mana like wagyu's rich in fat." </p>

                <p>"So, we really are just mana livestock..." I mutter.</p>

                <p>"The thing is... Even then, the big picture is that someone was trying to reach The Root. All magi are, but it feels like someone was trying to reach it right <em>now.</em> Someone like Arekusa."</p>

                <p>Arekusa. I'd almost forgotten the name until now. Just where the heck was she supposed to fit in? For someone who basically commissioned The Tower, she was mysteriously absent from any telltail snitch we ran into. </p>

                <p>I groan. Every time I think we're on the verge of figuring it out, there's always another complication. </p>

                <p>"To even think of reaching The Root... there has to be something much bigger than what we're seeing," Shiori bites her lip in absolute consternation. "A grand murder ritual can be a powerful spark. But where's the combustibles?"</p>

                <p>"Combustions."</p>

                <p>"So, you make an entire town vanish. But first, before anyone else, Prima disappears... then Monika disappears. Finally, the whole town disappears. But only Prima came back?" Shiori's writing and erasing, and writing and erasing. The whole page is smudges by now. "It just doesn't make sense. Where could Monika have possibly gone...?" Shiori the magus asks.</p>

                <p>I'm pretty sure Shiori the person couldn't care less. Much less Shiori the kid.</p>

                <p>For what it's worth, as far as the adults were concerned Monika's disappearance wasn't much of a mystery at all. She always hated Sussurokawa, and wasn't exactly fond of Shiori. It was easy to believe she'd cavalierly abandon responsibility, consequences be damned. But we knew better. It was too suspicious, given everything else. It just wasn't easy to figure out how the disappearances fit in the bigger picture. </p>

                <p>"Did you forget that Monika disappeared before the murders?" I ask.</p>

                <p>"Kind of...? It's not like with the seance. It's just that so much happened back then that Monika disappearing didn't... register on my radar very much. For me, it just meant the sleepovers kept going."</p>

                <p>Can't say I blame her. For all the twinges of regret I've been feeling lately, my heart's pure stone when it comes to Shiori's foul aunt. I mean... just look at the note she left!</p>

                                
                <p id="quote">Shiori. I found someone wonderful in the next town. A man I can love. I'm sorry to leave you, but you don't look like you want me anyway. I may have stayed if I thought you cared, but even small things can drive someone away. No hard feelings. I hope you'll grow up to be a sincere and mature person.</p>
                <br><br>
                <p id="quote"> Monika</p>

                <p>Yep. Leave it to a worthless person like Monika to shoehorn in one last emotional slap.</p>

                <p>"This is definitely her handwriting. I <em>know</em> she wrote this note. A-and... Monika did have a reputation for being a nut gobbler..."</p>
                
                <p>"That's such a weird phrase. Is that really what they said? Nut gobbler? Not wanton harlot? Nightwalker? Huffy little prostitute?"</p>

                <p>Shiori gapes a bit, but goes on popping a chestnut colored chew into her mouth. "You know, if you were a mean girl on a soap opera you'd be really good at it... Oh! I feel smarter after eating that one!"</p>

                <p>I give a tsk of the tongue, the sound enhanced by the candy rolling around my mouth.</p>

                <p>"Maybe the disappearances now have something to do with the children disappearing before? Revenge, maybe? Prima and Monika both seem like exactly the kind of horrible women who'd kidnap kids and make stew from their innards."</p>

                <p>"Yeah, but... Monika's not old enough for that. Prima, though..."</p>

                <p>We're in the midst of our discussion, when Nick comes staggering in. He looks exhausted. Way back in the "real past" I always thought he was older than he really was, mostly because he toiled away restlessly, but without that cold steely nature my mom had. Looking at him now, I just see a young man who works too hard. Probably emotionally as much as physically, given how much he does for Hannah.</p>

                        <P>"You kids not too bored? You didn't give yourself a stomach ache, did you?" Nick reaches for the huge jar of candy we've got on the counter.</P>

                        <p>"No way," I pull the jar back fast. "Kids don't get stomach aches."</p>

                        <p>"Yeah!" Shiori agrees, grabbing a creamy and raspberry colored chocolate. "Never. Oh good god! That one tastes like... like tongue!" </p>

                <p>"Uhuh." Nick gives a resigned at flat-faced look. But he's got bigger worries, I'm sure. If he looked tired before, it's worse than ever now. There's a reason we're with him. </p>

                <p>Things have gotten kinda... bad. Since The Garden Party. Al got sick, and Hannah got sick too, apparently. I haven't figured out with what, but... The timing's pretty suspicious, all things considered. After all, they're the first murder victims. But practically speaking, it's not easy to get close and get a better sense of what's going on. Especially when just being near anyone pulls us back hard into revertigo. </p>
                
                <p>So, we've just had act opportunistically. There's been chances, here and there. Shiori and I have at least seen Hannah, sometimes, smiling weakly and keeping an uncharacteristic distance. A pale look, like she's always on the verge of throwing up, there's never a time I see her without her handkerchief pressed right up to her face -- almost like she doesn't even want to breathe. </p>

                <p>No one wants to tell either of us what's wrong with Al. But my ears have picked up on it. As they talk to each other. Somethings wrong with his eyes. Sounds like a rash... also sounds like burns. I don't know. But since Al was the one who was taking care of Hannah, and Hannah was the one who was at least on paper taking care of Al, it's been a real issue. And all adults with hands to spare have just been taking turns shuffling in and out of The Creepy Peach.  </p>

                <p>Well... except Clarie. Clarie was already someone that you almost never saw, so that didn't change. But I've heard them talking about her. Especially my mom, who seems more exasperated than anybody, even while she's trying her best to sound sympathetic in front of Kyrie. </p>

                <em>Her crying at night's gotten worse.</em>
<br>
                <em>She's always crying, Kyrie. You know that.</em>
<br>
                <em>...It's different now, Lessie. I can tell. A twin knows.</em>
<br>
                <em>What do you want me to do? We're barely taking care of Al. Then, Hannah's having an even bigger breakdown than usual...</em>
          <br>      
                <em>I know. I know, Lessie. I know you don't like Clarie. But- </em>
                <br>
                <em>That's not true, Kyrie. Don't put words in my mouth.</em>
                <br>
                <em>...Okay. We'll leave that one alone. But what I'm trying to say is you mean a lot to Clarie. More than you realize. She looks up to you. </em>
<br>
                <em>...Are you serious? I... Look. I can... check on her from time to time. If I'm near the inn.</em>

                <p>And so on. </p>
                
                <p>Whatever the case, something's going on with Clarie too. Maybe something that's been going on a long time. I was a little shocked to hear it, honestly. Sure, Clarie's not exactly the boldest girl I ever met. She definitely had some of that... girl-failure feel. But I never would've thought she's the type to cry every night.</p>

                <p>"Oh! This one's like I'm eating ice cream! Nick, how do you do that?!" This one tastes so good the wonder's just seeping into my voice.</p>

                <p>"If I told you the secret, it wouldn't work as well anymore," Nick says, a little bit of a happy smirk on his face. "That said..."</p>

                <p>Nick reaches for the candy jar.</p>

                <p>"I don't know if I can just leave you in the candy store all day, though," Nick says a tad reproachfully. "You're gonna blow up your stomac-"</p>

                <p>Once again I pull the jar back, this time handing it to Shiori behind me. Yorick stands guard in front of it from Nick's oppressive, tyrannical, nanny-state meddling hands.</p>

                <p>"That's a myth, Nick. Candy can't blow up your stomach." Probably. Chew chew. </p>
                <p>"That's not true! One time, I saw a picture of so-" Shiori starts.</p>
                <p>"Shiori, shut up if you want to keep the jar!"</p>
                <p>"Oh, right!" Chew chew chew. </p>

                <p>Nick's watching us right now because on top of everything else, the town's water filtration system broke down. I don't know why it surprised me to hear that we had one. I guess even at Sussurokawa we drink modern water. But my mom's the one going up to fix it, and Nick was the only competent babysitter left. I mean. Chaperone. </p>

                <p>"She really can do everything..." I mutter.</p>

                <p>"Can't she? Your mom's an amazing woman, Meru. Not that you need me to tell you," Nick says.</p>

                <p>"I don't know how I'd feel if I were part of the town though. I get she's the mayor and al-"</p>
                <p>"Vicereine!" Shiori sharply interrupts. </p>

                <p>I think she just wanted to get back at me always correcting her.</p>

                <p>"...I know she's the vicereine and all, but I don't see why my mom can't get a proper water engineer to come."</p>
                <p>"Ehhh, it's a weird system. You could say it's a town fixture. Antiquated's not quite the right word... but it's not modern. But the people like it like that. I hate to say it because it's actually properly my duty to fix it," Nick rubs the back of his neck sheepishly. "It's infrastructure one of my great greats or great great greats put in. I'm sure the Otkropenkos would be rolling around in their grave if they knew I wasn't the one maintaining it. But I just don't have the mechanical skills."</p>

                <p>"Can we seriously not afford something new?" I ask.</p>

                <p>"People love the taste. It's a slow sand filtration system. You don't see those around anymore, because it's easier to just chlorinate everything and be done with it. But doing it this way keeps the natural taste of our famous springs," Nick says.</p>

                <p><em>"Every</em> podunk town pretends their springs are special," I say, and Nick laughs harder than I've seen him manage the whole time I've been back.</p>

                <p>"Hell -- erm -- heck, you're not wrong. I like it though. It's natural and organic. The way things are meant to be. You kids wanna know what keeps the water safe? Dirt. And bacteria."</p>

                <p>"...huh? Did you forget a few words? It keeps the water safe <em>from</em> bacteria."</p>
                <p>"Oh. Oh, I know this one!" Shiori beams. "The good dirt eats the bad dirt!"</p>
                <p>"That's right, Shiori. The water runs slow over sand, slow enough that a thin film called a <em>Schmutzdecke</em> forms. That means dirt blanket in German."</p>

                <p>"...How's that work?" I ask. I don't really want to know. But I can't stop myself. </p>

                <p>"It makes the proper environment for the right kind of biofilm," Nick shrugs. "Think of it like this. Stagnant and swampy water's kinda like, um.... hm. What's a polite..."</p>

                <p>"It's kinda poopy!" Shiori says the quiet thing really loud.</p>

                <p>Ugh. I'm eating a soft candy right now too. </p>

                <p>"Right, it's kinda poopy," Nick says, clearly relieved he doesn't have to waste an energy euphemizing. "That's the kinda environment great for bad biology. It's like the inside of your body. So, it's great for the kind of organisms that love to live inside your body and grow fast and multiply. A Schmutzdecke is an environment for the guys who love to eat the bad guys." </p>

                <p>"B-but... we're still drinking water that's fillled with dirt and bacteria?" I ask.</p>

                <p>"That's right."</p>
                <p>"Ugh..." I gag. "That's still kind of gross. I'm just gonna drink bottled water from now on..."</p>

                <p>"Well, you don't have a choice until your mom fixes it. I've already got people screaming at me like it's my fault. Man, they wouldn't even have anything to drink if I wasn't up late, out and about, making sure those lazy damn truckers get the shipments here on time! Man. Just... man. " Nick hangs his head. </p>

                <p>Shiori pats Nick softly on the back to comfort him, but I think this just makes him feel more pathetic.</p>

                <p>All of a sudden, I feel an acidy taste in my mouth. Ulp.</p>

                <p>Maybe the talk about sand water filters, Schmutzdeckes and bacteria got to me, because my stomach hurts out of nowhere.. And I feel nauseated. Or did I contract some kind of horrible disease like Al and Hannah...?</p>

                <p>"I-I feel really bad," I hear myself moaning. </p>

                <p>Shiori gets a panicked look on her face, then clutches her stomach too.</p>

                <p>"Auugh! Me too! A-are we gonna die, Nick?!" Shiori's eyes shake as Yorick looks fretfully from me to her and back.</p>

                <p>Nick sighs. "You ate too much candy."</p>

                <hr>
                <hr>

                <p>"I wanna learn to cook! Wait no, I wanna churn butter!"</p>

                <p>"How about we start with the first one, Shiori? Then we can start making everything from scratch on Hannah's farm. I'm sure she'd love that." Nick pulls out an aged looking crock-pot that was probably white once upon a time, but now's an aged beige -- the color of teeth that don't get brushed enough.  </p>

                <p>"Jeeze, Betty Crocker herself must have used this pot..." I mumble.</p>

                <p>"Betty Crocker wasn't a real person Meru," Shiori says.</p>

                <p>Nick's boutique has a small kitchenette stashed away for his own use. Even in his alone time, he's pretty industrious -- trying out new recipes for fun, it sounds like. </p>
                
                <p>"Cooking a stew in a crockpot is the one thing you can't mess up, because you can put whatever you want into it and it'll still taste pretty good," Nick says, bringing some basic ingredients out. Some chicken, some carrots and other vegetables, some--</p>

                <p>"Marshmallows!" Shiori bubbles, having let herself into a pantry she wasn't technically actually invited into.  </p>

                <p>"Er... you know what. That's my fault. I said 'anything' and I really shouldn't ha-" Nick tries to stop Shiori, but she's already thrown the marshmallows into the crockpot. Guess she really can't help being a kid.</p>
                
                <p>"You can't just add ingredients haphazardly Shiori..." I can't stop myself from smacking my forehead. "We'll have to make some kind of marshmallow beschamel like they do on TV now..."</p>

                <P>Which means we're gonna need a lot of cream cheese. Nick's just staring at the crockpot with a desolate look. Yeah. I don't trust Shiori either.</P>

                <p>"Hey! Stop adding more maple syrup!" I notice Shiori adding even more ingredients. "Now we gotta add like eight more spoons of salt!" 
                        
                <p>I am so tired of this child next to me messing up the stew.</p>

                <hr>

                <P>Now we're just waiting for the stew to cook. Nick has been silent for a while, staring at the pot.</P>

                <p>"Meru, we could open up a restaurant, you know? Making stews seems really easy," Shiori says.</p>

                <p>"Are you serious? Sussurokawa doesn't have the economy for it. We'd have to move to the big city," I sigh.</p>

                <p>"Ahaha... Oh man. I don't even know what to say," Nick laughs with a pained look, still staring at the pot. Maybe he's thinking about how hard it is to make a profit here. "I'll just call it a learning experience... wait, you're not gonna make me eat this are you?"</p>

                <p>"Huh? Why wouldn't you?" I ask. Nick just groans for some reason.</p>


                <p>All that's left is to let it cook a while now. </p>

                <p>"Nick?" Shiori tugs at Nick's slave. "Who taught you how to cook?" </p>

                <p>"...My mom did," Nick says. </p>
                <p>How can I describe the look he's got right now? Bittersweet, maybe. Like he can kinda eat black licorice, maybe. Chagrined isn't right, because I don't think he's embarrassed by anything. It's just an imperfect smile that wants to say a lot more than a smile ever could. </p>

                <p>"Before she left us," Nick hesitates, the way an adult does before they say something very real to children. "Before she took her own life, my mom loved to cook more than anything else. She taught me everything."</p>

                <p>"I'm so sorry..." Shiori says softly, looking at the ground. </p>

                <p>"No," Nick scratches his cheek. "It's not a fun story, but life goes on. You have to keep going. You just have to. It's not a story kids should ever have to hear, but..." </p>

                <p>"But?" I ask.</p>

                <p>"There's something about Sussurokawa that makes people nuts. If it's not cults, or the twilight woman, or missing children, then it's just being way off your rocker in general. Women maybe more than men. My mom was like that in the end. Hannah's mom Elysia was like that in the end. Hannah, now..." Nick trails off. </p>

                <p>"But that's why Kyrie's made it her mission to raise this place out of superstition. Fix everyone's heads up," Nick continues. "It's valiant, but... People here are just getting worse all the time. No matter what she does. Maybe you guys really should go and open that stew restaurant. Get out of town and plant roots somewhere new."</p>

                <p>"Um," I hesitate a moment, not knowing if it's appropriate to ask. "What happened to Hannah's mom?"</p>

                <p>"We don't really know what happened to her," Nick admits. "She just disappeared one day. I guess we're all... hoping she just up and left. Don't know how likely that is. Hannah's never been able to deal with it since. That's why Al took her in like his own daughter."</p>

                <p>He's got such a sad look on his face, with so much more pain than when he was talking about his mom, even. I guess you really do have to go on. But letting go of the past also means being willing to take on the pain of the present.</p>

                <p>"Nick, do you love Hannah?" Shiori asks.</p>

                <p>Nick tries to brush her off with a small laugh that doesn't even reach his cheeks. "One adult discussion to the next, huh?"</p>

                <p>"Do you?" Shiori asks without looking away. She's got resolution in her eyes. I guess it's important to her. No, actually. It's important to me, too. As much as I like Nick, if he's just a 'philandering cod,' then...</p>

                <p>"...I do," Nick says, realizing Shiori isn't playing around.</p>

                <p>Shiori gasps. "You love her? You want to marry her?"</p>

                <p>Nick looks around wildly as if she's hiding in the walls. "Shhh! For god's sake, if she heard you say that...."</p>

                <P>I kinda don't blame him, honestly. But when the immediate panic leaves his face, the real emotions start to emerge. Nick's a guy who's got so much exasperation going on all the time, it covers up the sadness, I think. Maybe it's easier for him that way. If you can only feel so much at once, better to be troubled and put upon than full of sorrow. </p>

                        <p>"Hannah... needs to get better. Before we can ever talk about children. Or marriage. Or even dating," Nick says. "None of that would help her. She doesn't need a boyfriend. She doesn't need a husband. She doesn't need a child, even -- not right now. She just... needs a friend."</p>

                        <p>"Right now Hannah's like... a flower in wilt. And if we don't fix the soil, if she doesn't get better -- she'll just keep quietly rotting away." Nick stares up at the ceiling, the slightest bit of despair creeping into his voice. "What's the point in bringing a kid in this world if they're just gonna bear the brunt of their mother's affliction?"</p>

                        <p>Somehow a lot of that story hits close to home. I can't bring myself to ask about my own mom. If she's ever gone Sussurokawa crazy. I can't bring myself to think about the end of Nick and Hannah's story, either. All I can do is try to live in the fake moment. </p>

                        <P>"You're a really good guy Nick," I say quietly. "That's why everyone likes you, except Al." </P>

                        <p>"Seriously? Even kids notice it?"</p>

                        <p>"He says even meaner things when you're gone!" Shiori chirps.</p>
                
                        <hr>
                        <p>"...What is this?" my mom asks, seething.</p>
                        <p>"Um," I look at the ground beside me. "When we were cooking it, it looked really good."</p>
                        <p>"Do... do you want some?" Shiori asks.</p>
                        <p>Contrary to expectations, marshmallow beschamel doesn't look appetizing at all. </p>

                        <p>"Nick, why are you teaching my daughter and Shiori to waste food?"</p>

                        <p>"Well, uh, you know, Lessie, it's like when you let a kid smoke a whole pack of cigs so they never smoke, right?" Nick panics. I shudder. That was the worst thing he could have said.</p>

                        <p>"That's a great metaphor, Nick," my mom says icily. "That's why to make sure no one here ever wastes food again, we're going to eat every bite."</p>

                        <p>And we did. And my mom later regretted it because Shiori threw up on our carpet when we got home. </p>

                        <hr>

                        <p>Sometimes, the memories only come back after I relive them.</p>

                        <p>Shiori made that awful stew in the past, just like today. I remember, because I remember how awful it felt eating the stew. I remember even my mom regretting her obsessive need to turn everything into a lesson, Nick's face of horror because he had the strongest sense of taste, the bottle of TUMs on the table 'cause I had to take a couple to not throw up myself. </p>

                        <p>Back then it seemed awful. Well... it was pretty awful reliving some of the physical parts, I'm not gonna lie.</p>

                        <p>But as I'm watching Shiori fall asleep peacefully on the couch, even with that droopy, sad face a kid takes when they're sick, hugging Yorick like a teddy bear, I remember that it was a happy memory at the end of the day. At least... we were all together. At least we're all together now. </p>

                        <p>It's just that... I'm remembering now. This was probably the last happy memory I ever had. </p>
