            <div class="main">
                <p>Feels like I've had a lot of these idle moments to reflect lately. Waves softly crashing on rocks, an
                    ugly lighthouse, and just our thoughts. It's different than being alone -- being silent next to
                    someone else I mean. But before I can even contemplate why, I hear a small crooing sound from behind
                    Shiori, and, sure enough, there's Yorick crooing fearfully while what looks like a huge origami bird
                    pecks at him.</p>

                <p>"Yorick!" Shiori shrieks.</p>

                <p>"Hey! Stop that! Go on, 'git!" I rush to my feet and start kicking dust at it. Now it's slightly
                    dusty paper, unhappy and dirty and petulantly preening itself as if I'm the one at fault. "Why would
                    you want to eat slime?!"</p>

                <p>"Oh! Oh!" Shiori scoops Yorick safely. "That's a telltail snitch!"</p>

                <p>"A what?" I ask.</p>

                <p>"A telltail snitch! They'll give you a secret if you show them what they want!" Shiori says.</p>

                <p>"Then why's it attacking Yorick?!"</p>

                <p>"They're proud, little things. Like snooty gossipers who adore flaunting that they know
                    <em>everyone</em> in town. Here, we gotta follow it!" Shiori jumps to her feet and away she goes to
                    give chase, though you'd think the snitch wasn't aware the way it lackadaisacally enters a lazy,
                    soaring start.
                </p>

                <p>The faux-bird is so <em>very</em>annoyingly ho hum, I can't help but think about the last, gasping
                    breaths of the vannaknoe in the cellar -- the one that kept its secrets safe 'till the very end.
                    Jeeze. It's a matter of attitude, is all.</p>

                <p>Secrets are important, but they don't make <em>you</em> important. This bratty, little origami bird
                    keeps peering back imperiously like it knows it's a Big Deal. Why, I oughta just grab its corners
                    and crease them to absolute wrinkledom and...</p>

                <p>Hey? Where are we now?</p>

                <p>"Wow! Look at this cool grotto! You don't usually see these so high up on a hill," Shiori muses.
                    "It's like a little hideaway."</p>

                <p>"Not just like a little hideaway," I say, peering into the dark, a single cold drop splashing onto my
                    face. "There's an extinguished campfire right there. And... it looks pretty ancient."</p>

                <p>I don't like this place. I know, I know. There haven't been a ton of places giving me good vibes in
                    this Tower. But this place in particular... gives me a really, sick and miserable feeling. I take my
                    thumb and wipe at the cold drop of water from just a second ago. It may as well have been my own
                    tear. As if I needed any help, now I really don't like that stupid telltail snitch. Bad things take
                    you to bad places.</p>

                <p>Places where you watch the rain fall and fall and fall, maybe. Right out there. I hate these
                    half-memories.</p>

                <p>"Hey! Um!" Shiori interrupts my thoughts. I can kinda tell she wanted to say my name. "There's a book
                    here. Look!"</p>

                <p>Sure enough, there's a rather thick hardcover right by the fire. It's a little tattered, but it's
                    still conspicuously out of place. You could probably shove it on the encyclopedia shelf at the
                    library and get away with it.</p>

                <p>"The... Codex Sussurokawa. That's way too ominous."</p>

                <p>"Ugh! I can't get it open!" Shiori tries to flip the book open. It doesn't look locked. But the pages
                    are clearly being held together by some mysterious force. Or some really subtle glue.</p>

                <p>Now the telltail snitch is pecking at it, and glaring at me, then pecking again, then glaring again.
                    Back-and-forth. Can't you be cute? Can't you fly on my shoulder whimsically like an actual nice
                    fantasy creature? But <em>fine.</em> I get it. I walk on over and, just like a normal book, the
                    Codex opens up.</p>

                <p>Finally! The telltail snitch hops on over with condescension, like I'm a waiter that took way too
                    long with its food, and flies up right onto the open page. Oh? It pecks here. It pecks there. It
                    makes itself a little nest of paper, and unfolds itself into the page, with all the cadence and vibe
                    of a mundane nighttime ritual.</p>

                <p>"It must be one of your diary pages! I bet we'll get your name!" Shiori says excitedly.</p>
