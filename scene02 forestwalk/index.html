            <p>Whoops. I lied! I'm actually a nervous, stomach twisted wreck again. Last night, as I tossed and turned
                onto my 39th sharp pebble of the night, the stabbing pain made me realize that if this is a place
                magically constructed from mine or Shiori's memories, then there's a good chance I'll have to meet
                <em>my memories.</em></p>

            <p>I mean, I guess that's the whole point of this homecoming. Reclaiming memory, or identity, or my name, or
                <em>whatever.</em> Which is all great and wonderful, but when every experience in the magical tower
                tells you that your amnesiac past was so dire it was worth sinking it to the bottom of a magical ocean,
            </p>

            <p>I'd be more than happy to leave it forgotten forever, but when I even intimated that Shiori's cheeks were
                already pre-emptively puffing up.</p>

            <p>"Do we really have to do this?" I ask, rocking back and forth on my heels listlessly as I watch the
                fire's embers die down. Gotta make sure it's out fully before pouring water over it.</p>

            <p>"Of course we do," Shiori replies with her know-it-all voice. "It could still be smoldering underneath
                there."</p>

            <p>I already knew that. That's not what I meant. I already knew that, Shiori. But whatever. Glancing at her,
                I notice something surprising. But wonderful.</p>

            <p>"Are you... shorter than me right now?" I ask.</p>

            <p>"...Perhaps a little bit. Why?" Shiori replies.</p>

            <p>"Nothing. I just like seeing you as a tiny pygmy in gothy clothing."</p>

            <p>Now her cheeks are really puffing up. But she doesn't say anything, and just keeps petting Yorick's head,
                shivering all the while. This morning's a good kind of crispy, and rather sunny despite being cold. It's
                less dismal than usual, some part of me seems to say, as if my nagging memories are also smoldering
                beneath the surface.</p>

            <p>"Alright," I say, pouring the fire out finally. "I think we're ready to go. Finally."</p>

            <p>I, of course, at a towering 150 or so centimeters (with some rounding) am prepared to take on a
                leadership role. Someone has to.</p>

            <p>Both of us are sticky, tired, and gross. Haggard would be a kind statement. I lead the way, faintly aware
                that I don't really know where we're headed, but looking back every so often to take cues from Shiori.
                If it were <em> really </em> up to me to choose our destination, I'd want to go nap somewhere soft and
                warm. Is that an option? Last night was the first time I was literally able to sleep since the literal
                start of my remembered existence.</p>

            <p>And it sucked.</p>

            <p>Murders and magic and memories seem so unimportant next to exhaustion. Or hunger. Or the aching feeling
                all through my my back and my frickin' <em>ribs</em>.</p>

            <p>Tired or not, into the woods we go, up the slope, from dry and loose sand dunes to patchy grass and
                splotting dabs of trees; trees which let the sunlight break through their orange, yellow, and green
                crowns.</p>

            <p>Splotchy's the best word for it all. Seriously. Everything's in a two tone war. The sand is giving way to
                grass. The verdant evergreens are fighting a losing battle against the increasingly anxious colors of
                the deciduous trees. And that beaming sun's making an admirable breech through the shadows.</p>

            <p>At the same time, creeks and streams run downhill all over the area like they own the place, with our
                only way through sometimes being big rocks semi-conveniently placed, clearly human hands trying to keep
                future feet from getting wet. But it's a futile effort. There's too many intersections, streams a little
                too high, and all over the babbling brooks run amok.</p>

            <p>It's like the whole area can't help but express itself in conflict. It's unsettling and beautiful and new
                and familiar all at the same time. There's something there, tugging at the reaches of my memory. Like
                it's about to pull me in... but not quite. It's the feeling of teething, except it's my baby teeth
                growing back.</p>

            <p>Speaking of babies, I can't help but notice Shiori's... currently not great with physical exertion.
                Hugging Yorick to herself like a teddy bear, she's got eyes like daffodils with morning dew, and she's
                breathing like she just ran a whole frickin' marathon. Jeeze.</p>

            <p>"Stop...please, a m-moment..." Shiori's body slumps so hard I worry she's about to fall over. And she
                sort of, er, <em>does</em>, languidly drooping against a tree trunk, head resting against it like it's
                her boyfriend.</p>

            <p>I guess I can't be too harsh here. Uphill serpentine paths with downhill serpentine streams. It takes a
                big toll on these small bodies. Or at least it <em>should.</em>I must have been some kind of athletic
                child prodigy, the way I'm breezing through.</p>

            <p>"You look so smug right now, even I'm getting annoyed," Shiori mutters.</p>

            <p>"S-smug? You're imagining things." Oops. Is there a smirk on my face I need to wipe off? Time to deflect.
                "Why the heck are we kids, anyway?"</p>

            <p>As I say this, I can't help but notice how much bigger Yorick looks now that we're so small. Or is he
                actually bigger? Like to match our younger personality's, he's also been resized -- like a stuffed
                animal. His inky body's taken on this fringed, soft-spiky look that I can only guess is trying to cheer
                Shiori on. He always looks frazzled, but I think he feels a little guilty right now.</p>

            <p>"Oh Yorick, there's no need to feel bad." I wonder what those inky tassels feel like... I reach out to
                pet him, but Shiori not-so-subtly pulls away like she suddenly needed to pace.</p>

            <p>Can I be real for a second? I'm pretty sure she just doesn't want to share.</p>

            <p>"Could be â€” I think it's because some Constructs make your physical embodiment match your mindset," she
                finally says. "That must be happening to us?"</p>

            <p>"...So, we're both just immature mental twelve year olds in arrested development. Like, noticeably less
                mature."</p>

            <p>"Mmm, maybe? I bet coming back here's caused a regress," she says, hugging Yorick tightly, obliviously,
                almost petulantly. That last bit might be bias.</p>

            <p>But there's a bigger issue right now. The whole mental regress thing feels like it could be a major
                obstacle. Especially if...</p>

            <p>"Um, are we gonna run into people? What happens if we <em> do </em> run into people?" I ask, feeling a
                weird nervous tingle run through my fiddling hands.</p>

            <p>People being townspeople. People from our past. People I can't even remember.</p>

            <p>"I'm not sure. I still haven't figured out the logic of this Construct. Is it digging from your memories?
                Both of our memories? I didn't... expect to come back here. I need time to think." Her voice comes out
                soft and pensive. Almost plaintive. //optimize</p>

            <p>Who can blame her? With what little memories I have, I can guess Sussurokawa was probably some stuck-up,
                podunk town, where every resident had a mean old provincial outlook. My chest tightens just thinking
                about it.</p>

            <p>"So, should we avoid them?" I ask.</p>

            <p>"No. They might be able to help... And they should be easy enough to manage, 'cause I bet they'll act
                like NPCs. Thinking about the places your name could be hidden... they might be able to help us find it
                or something," she ponders, clicking her tongue all the while. "Like your diary. One of the NPCs might
                know where to find it." //optimize</p>

            <p>"I'm not sure how you're so sure I kept a diary," I grumble, though I don't know exactly what an NPC is.
                Though I can guess? And why would they know <em> where it is?</em> How bad at keeping secrets would I be
                if every Joe Schmoe in town knew where I kept it?</p>

            <p>"Of course you kept a diary," Shiori frowns. "You were just that kind of girl."</p>

            <p>"Was I now?" I mutter. Feels awfully strange... no, maybe just awful, having my own personality explained
                to me. A flutter in my belly. A tingling in my limbs. And this feeling like there's way too much spit in
                my mouth. "How far are we, anyway?"</p>

            <p>Shiori wracked her brain. "Ummm, I think we're really close. We're gonna get up to the cliff right across
                from the lighthouse. Then... your house is close to that. It's always been suuuper high on the hill."
            </p>

            <p>Lighthouse. For a moment, everything goes white in my vision. The word sets off all kinds of reactions.
                Physiological and psychological. The alarms are bleating in my head. It's the last place I want to go.
                It's the place I need to be.</p>

            <p>And sure enough, before long, just like Shiori said it comes streaking into view like a giant traffic
                cone.</p>

            <p>It's... kind of ugly?</p>

            <p>You know, <em>it makes sense</em> that a lighthouse would be white and orange, and wayyyyy too rusty. But
                somehow I imagined something grander. It wouldn't be pristine or anything. Just scarier looking? But
                there it is, standing stark against the sky like something a soccer mom tips over with her van.</p>

            <p>And for the moment, those alarms quiet down. Shiori, meanwhile, is stopping and staring at it with an
                expression I can't read. <em>Shiori</em> of all people, with an expression of utter complexity, throwing
                off every read I thought I had on her. It's a pained expression, sure. But... isn't it... a little too
                nostalgic?</p>

            <p>Shouldn't she hate this place?</p>

            <p>I can hear the screaming townspeople. I can see the mob. It's a flash, but I <em>know</em> something
                happened.</p>

            <p>And yet here she is, staring away with the softest look, lightly dabbing her eyes with one hand while her
                opposite arm dangles pseudo-teddy-bear Yorick.</p>

            <p>"I- I studied at a place called The Lighthouse, you know. Instead of The Clocktower. It's for us
                reneg...reneging..." Shiori stumbles.</p>

            <p>"Renegade?" I suggest.</p>

            <p>"Renegade! Right, right. Renegade magi. We're renegades because we aren't so renegade. Crazy and
                dangerous. That's normal for a magus. We're the ones with softer and whimsyish admon...admonitions."</p>

            <p>"Aspirations? Ambitions?"</p>

            <p>"Admonitions!" Shiori scowls and doubles down, apparently starting to get annoyed at my corrections. "But
                lighthouses have a special meaning for magi. The light at the top of a lighthouse... for so many, it's a
                symbol of The Origin. The Root. It's the light of truth."</p>

            <p>"Wait. Then isn't it weird that the place you studied is called The Lighthouse? If you're the ones with
                the small-time ambitions, feels like you should be called ... The Lightbulb."</p>

            <p>Uh oh. That might be a step too far. With how small our bodies are, it's kinda obvious when we start
                shaking with rage. Apparently.</p>

            <p>"That's because magi are stupid. They don't even know how lighthouses work, "she mutters flatly, and
                brushes on past. "The Root unroots people. Ironically. Magi get so obsessed with it that entire
                liners...line...lineages chase after it. Sometimes families go on for centuries. And sometimes... they
                just go nuts. It's not unlike lighthouse madness. Eep!"</p>

            <p>By now we're both sitting and staring. Feet dangling a little precariously off the cliff, and Shiori just
                heard a rock fall down and started hugging Yorick tighter. Thinking twice, she makes sure to set him a
                little behind us 'cause she doesn't wanna drop him.</p>

            <p>"Centuries and centuries of these decrepit men and women chasing after it... And no one's found it. I
                doubt it even exists," I snort.</p>

            <p>"Of course it exists," Shiori says chidingly, her tone surprisingly <em>measured</em> like I'm the child
                here. "Even if you forget who your parents are. It's not as if you came out of nowh-- oh u-um, well
                t-they just know logically, alright?"</p>

            <p>Her face is completely red while she's tripping over her own faux pas. I don't really care that she said
                it. And it's cute to see her fluster. But... I do get a little depressed remembering it. Or <em>not</em>
                remembering, actually. Who I am. Why I'm here. I just try to sit and contemplate it. She's been rambling
                all the while to try and move past it.</p>

            <p>"S, so! There was this one crazy family, right? Or they weren't <em>that</em> crazy. But they try to
                reach The Root by breeding someone really beautiful. As beautiful as possible," Shiori bloviates. "So
                beautiful it's absolutely transcendent."</p>

            <p>"And how would that possibly work?" I ask.</p>

            <p>"It's the closest anyone's ever gotten. We only ever get glimpses from when things are <em>max.</em> It's
                about superness," Shiori says.</p>

            <p>"Superlativeness," I say.</p>

            <p>"<em>Superness,</em>" she hmphs. "So, every generation. They're breeding a new princess. They call her
                the Princess of Gold. Each one is more beautiful than the last. They're being controlled down to their
                genetics. Maybe their <em>soul.</em> One of them was even supposed to look just like Helen of Troy! But
                then! Do you know what happened then?!"</p>

            <p>"They started getting uglier?"</p>

            <p>"No! No... it's... sadder than that," she pauses. "They started experiencing reversal... it's like... if
                you're climbing a ladder up and up, forever! And you've always been doing it, because everything you
                want is at the top. But then -- then you look down."</p>

            <p>We both look down at the water crashing upon rocks. She shudders. I think I shudder a bit, too.</p>

            <p>"And then," Shiori continues. "You just think... I want to jump. You've been climbing your whole life.
                But you can't get it out of your head! You try to shake it off. You try to keep climbing but it's not
                the same anymore. And every so often you look down and... all you can think of is that brief moment of
                flight. Like that's what you did all this climbing for."</p>

            <p>"Alright," I say softly. "What does jumping mean here?"</p>

            <p>"It means! They cut her head off!" Shiori grabs Yorick and holds him up like he's a decapitated head
                instead of a little ball of slime, and he does this cute glowering thing like <em>he's</em> scary, and
                all his tendrils stand up like fur on an angry cat. "Or I mean! Her brother did! He cut up her limbs,
                and arranged them on this bed with sheets of pure white, um, until they got stained red of course. And!
                It was like an art piece! It was like he was an expiring artist, expiring for something unconventional,
                and so he deconstructed her! It was literal deconstruction!"</p>

            <p>Absolutely breathless, with delivery so on point that I can tell she's said this one a bunch. Though her
                morbid fascination seems to be giving way to trembling as she thinks about the story again. Maybe that's
                what's fun about it. It's like a housewife so hooked on true crime, she made the grocery store parking
                lot scary.</p>

            <p>Or maybe make a big 'ole traffic cone scary.</p>

            <p>"And we're supposed to read ALL of that? From this lighthouse?" I ask. "Just how's that supposed to work?
                Lighthouses <em>save</em> people."</p>

            <p>"Well, yeah! Duh! But you know... if you're a ship in the fog looking for a safe port clear of rocks,
                you're not supposed to go <em>towards</em> the lighthouse. Because that's..."</p>

            <p>Oh.</p>

            <p>Because that's where the rocks are.</p>
