                        <p>"Playing scholar for today, huh?" Al strokes his beard as he approaches. "You two have always
                                struck me as smarter than other kids your age, that's true."</p>

                        <p>"Even me?" Shiori beams. "How come you're already awake, Al?"</p>

                        <p>"Especially you Shiori," he says with a kind, old man smile. "And how could I not be? What,
                                with all the arguing?"
                        </p>

                        <p>"O-oh. Sorry about that-" I start."</p>

                        <p>"No, no, I'm not talking about you two," he grumbles. "You'll see when you come down to eat.
                        </P>


                        <p>And sure enough, the moment we get downstairs, Nick and Hannah are going at it. Though,
                                really, it seems to be a mostly one-sided affair with Hannah fruitlessly flailing her
                                hands against Nick's shoulder.</p>

                        <p>"I hate you, Nick! I'd hate you even more if I didn't love you!" Hannah wails.</p>
                        <p>
                                "Hannah, I can't believe you are seriously talking about children when we're not even
                                <em>dating.</em>"

                        </p>
                        <p>
                                "How? How can you say we're not dating when you've told me you loved me?!" Hannah
                                screams.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                                "I- I shouldn't have said tha-"

                        </p>
                        <p>
                                "Don't say another word, you brute! Don't take it back! I don't wanna hear it!" Hannah
                                theatrically walks up to Nick just to slap him, before starting to dash out. But the
                                door's so heavy, she struggles against it, and after a few seconds Nick sighs, walks
                                over, and pushes it open the rest of the way for her.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                                Then she gives him another light slap and runs off weepily.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                                "Woah..." Shiori says.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                                "Nick, did you really say you loved her?" I eye him warily.

                        </p>

                        <p>So this is what people mean when they say someone's got a deer in the headlights look. He's
                                just totally frozen. Seems like he's trying to figure out what to say, but all he can
                                manage is to lamely point at some sandwiches all nicely wrapped on the table. </p>
                        <p>
                                Al just glares daggers into him. "What are you doing, you imbecile?! Chase after her for
                                god's sake!"
                        </p>

                        <p>"Right! You're right!" To his credit, that verbal slap on the back's all it takes, and Nick's
                                out the door immediately. "Hannah! Hannah, come on!"</p>

                        <p>In the wake of that whirlwind melodrama, there's not much left except silence and some tasty
                                sandwiches. Al's got his hand to his temple with his eyes closed, as if he's got a
                                pounding headache."That dumb bastard," Al growls. "Let's start heading to that magic
                                show of yours, Miss Shiori. I need to stroll this vexation away."</p>

                        <p>Still, vexed as he is, he still makes sure to pack the sandwiches Nick made.</p>

                        <hr>

                        <p>Leave it to kids to be nonplussed by adult drama. As we walk through the woods with Al,
                                Shiori and I are engaged in a serious debate.</p>

                        <p>"I always thought they were dating," Shiori says, mouth full of sandwich. </p>

                        <p>"Huh? No way." It feels good to be a kid and just talk with my mouth full. Though, I don't
                                think my mom would've let it fly. "You heard him. They're <em>not</em>dating. He said it
                                over and over."</p>

                        <p>"Yeah, but that's just what people who are dating say sometimes!" Shiori retorts.</p>

                        <p>"No, it's really not."</p>

                        <p>"But they <em>love</em> each other!"</p>

                        <p>"Huh? Is that really the impression you got?"</p>

                        <p>"Yeah! Otherwise Nick would be some kind of... philanthropizing cod!"</p>

                        <p>"...you mean, philandering cad?"</p>

                        <p>Al, strolling ahead, seems a lot more put out by the whole thing. Honestly, I'm not sure why.
                                If he hates Nick as much as he seems to, then it should be a good thing that Hannah
                                seems to be reaching her limit with his wishy washiness.</p>

                        <p>"Al, why do you hate Nick so much?" Shiori strolls up to Al and asks the quiet thing out
                                loud.</p>

                        <p>"Hmm," Al scratches his head, while slowing down to walk right next to her. He leans his
                                stocky body over as if to literally lend her his ear. "Why, indeed?"</p>

                        <p>"<em>Do</em> you actually hate him?" Shiori asks. I feel my own ears perk up in curiosity.
                        </p>

                        <p>"Catch me on a bad day," he grumbles, mostly to himself. "And I'd tell you I'd love nothing
                                more for him to slip on pig dung and crack his head open. But I ought to be level-headed
                                around you children. When I'm being fair, I'm as aware as anyone else I'm barkin' up the
                                wrong tree with all this anger."</p>

                        <p>Al sighs and rubs the back of his neck, before continuing on. "It just pains me to see a girl
                                I love like a daughter to be so hopelessly infatuated and then be thrown about by the
                                tides of love."</p>

                        <p>Now I hop up to them to walk along. "Is Nick leading her on?"</p>

                        <p>Al winces, seeming to think that's a bit too adult of a concept to come out of a child's
                                mouth. "No, he's... he's got his reasons. Hannah's got some demons to conquer, you see.
                                And it scares us all to think sometimes she... well, that she might not win. Sometimes
                                it's easier to be angry than it is to be scared, Miss Mu, Miss Shiori. I hope when
                                you're older the two of you'll know that doesn't make it right."</p>

                        <p>Not much kids can say to that. We all just walk in silence for a while, each with our own
                                objects to fidget with. Shiori's got Yorick. I've got the sandwiches in a basket. And
                                Al's actually brought along a flashlight for when we walk back later, so he's making
                                sure it works.</p>

                        <p>Honestly, walking back through the woods at night with kids isn't exactly safe in the first
                                place, but I'm remembering Al wasn't ever someone you'd call 'prudent' when it came to
                                childcare. With Monika being the way she is, Al was always the closest thing Shiori had
                                to a real guardian. And when it came to the 'guard' part, he really wasn't much of one,
                                because he seemed to think children are as invincible as they're energetic.</p>

                        <p>I remember one time that Shiori convinced me that we should try to sail down one of the
                                Rumeuri Hill creeks in a pool float, and Al just stroked his beard and said it was a
                                'mighty fine adventure for tiny sailors.' We ended up getting thrown into some bushes
                                when the float popped against some banks. My mom was really furious, and I couldn't play
                                with Shiori for a week. It might've been even longer if Al hadn't come to my house and
                                apologized over and over.</p>

                        <p>"Al, when'd I ask you to take me to the magic show again? I don't remember." Shiori peers up
                                at him from the side. How much of it is Shiori the mage trying to piece a chain of
                                events together, and how much of it is just kid Shiori being an airhead I'm not sure.
                        </p>

                        <p>"You don't remember? You wrote me such a nice note too, Miss Shiori. I'd say you've got a
                                future as a writer, you know? Hell, I've even got it in my glasses case this very
                                moment!" Al wags his index finger in the air for Shiori like an old cartoon character,
                                getting a nice giggle out of her. Then he pulls out a small glasses case from his
                                pocket, and opens it up to pull out a small handwritten note. </p>

                        <p id="quote">Dear Mr. Krabb. Do you want to see the magic show with me? My aunt Monika does not
                                want to see the magic show with me. I thought that since you liked old sailor stories,
                                you must love wonder and the unknown. There are lots of fun mysteries in the world and I
                                think you would like this one. I know you can't sail anymore, but a display of magecraft
                                is an adventure of its own! Please let me know. Love, Shiori. P.S. Please hide your
                                response note where Monika can't find it. There's a really big red rock right by the
                                bakery!</p>

                                <p>I feel mean for thinking this, but Shiori was a surprisingly articulate writer even as a child. From her ditziness and often happy-go-lucky attitude you'd really never guess. I definitely didn't know as a kid. </p>

                        <p>"Can't say I was too interested in passin' notes like my grammar school days," Al says
                                scratching his head. "So, I thought I'd just go and pick you up on the day of. That's
                                when I ran into your fussy mess of an aunt."</p>
                        <p>"Why'd you bring your reading glasses, anyway?" Shiori asks. </p>

                        <p> " I just figured I'd solve some crossword puzzles or somethin' while we're waiting for the
                                show to begin."</p>

                        <p>
                                "You like crossword puzzles?" Shiori asks.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                                "That's right," he chuckles. "I bet you thought us sailors were dumb, huh?"

                        </p>
                        <p>
                                "Never!"

                        </p>
                        <p>
                                "Well, you're wise not to underestimate me Miss Shiori," Al grins. "I've been all over
                                the world."

                        </p>
                        <p>
                                "When?"

                        </p>
                        <p> "Hell if I remember. All that's just a figment of the past nowadays. At this point, only
                                thing I know's that Sussurokawa's got just about the worst sand I've ever set foot on."
                        </p>

                        <p> "Aw, but I like the sand here..." Shiori frowns. I feel a little offended too. I
                                <em>also</em> like the sand here. But she keeps pestering him: "Where's the best sand in
                                the world, then?"</p>

                        <p>
                                "The Florida panhandle! But that doesn't mean you should ever go to Florida!"

                        </p>
                        <p>
                                "Never! I won't!"</p>

                        <p>"Good girl," Al smiles, his good mood coming back fast. </p>

                        <p>While Shiori and Al happily chat away, I notice the note he folded and tucked back into his
                                glasses case is peeking out again. Like a bird whose cage was left open, the snitch
                                clearly needed a moment to realize freedom is a real prospect. The open gate
                                <em>isn't</em> some trick.</p>

                        <p>This one's got the look of a fat little sparrow. I mean, it's <em>paper</em>, but it's got a
                                whole big round fold in the front that almost looks fluffed up. I surreptitiously walk
                                by with The Codex, and it jumps right on in like it's a bird bath. </p>

                                        Today Mˍˍˍˍˍˍu and I were reading The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe and it was a lot of fun! She actually likes to read, but it's always stuff for adults. I don't know if I've ever seen her read fiction.

                                        I'm not sure that she always understands what she's reading. Today she was lugging this really heavy book called... hold on diary, I have it on a scrap of paper... "Fiscal Policy in an Increasingly Globalized World: Strategy for Competing with Multinationals"
                                        <br><br>
                                        Um. She might be a bit of a poser... but that's okay.

                                        I get lonely when Mˍˍˍˍˍˍu can't play. 
                                        <br><br>
                                        When Al is free I like to do things with him. I like everyone on Rumeuri. But they're also usually busy. 
                                        <br><br>
                                        The people in town are nice too, but I don't always know them well and after everything I don't want to trust too many people even if they're nice. I spend a lot of time by the creeks. 

                                        <br><br>
                                        I know I shouldn't be doing this but sometimes I just like to experiment with what I can do with the bookmark. I don't like having it but... it's also a part of me now. It feels like a part of my body and it feels like it hurts me physically not to move it at all.

                                        Today I accidentally blabbed to everyone that Mˍˍˍˍˍˍu can't swim and she got really mad at me. So, I spent a lot of time at the creek... I can make all kinds of cool shadow shapes with the bookmark now, though! Like a flower with a creepy eye... 
                                        <br><br>
                                        Or a little knight man with a creepy eye...

                                        <br><br>
                                        They look really cool! Pop! I can make them from nothing, just mana and it's like this flash of light! And then when I have to make them pop <em>out</em> of existence I feel a little sad.

                                        A lot of people in Sussurokawa believe in magic. There's even a cult. They all seem nice though. Sometimes people with the cult clothes give me free candy.
                                        <br><br>
                                        One of them told me about their rituals, and he said "It's real magecraft, Shiori." I got super excited. Sometimes it gets lonely as the only magus in town. I wonder if it's really magecraft. 
                                        <br><br>
                                        Even better, though, they said their meeting today was gonna be all about Kurakira. That's my favorite cryptid!
                                        <br><br>

                                </div>
                        </div>

                        <p>I have such incredibly mixed feelings about a nine or ten year old Shiori calling me a poser. I actually feel really flustered about it. It's like... when you think you're the perceptive one but you're not even perceptive enough to notice someone you know is actually really perceptive. And when you <em>finally notice</em> it makes you question how much you've really been paying attention.</p>

                        <p>...That intense flareup of embarrassment isn't the problem though.  This Codex entry is activating my sixth sense for trouble. The word cult? Trouble. Kurakira? I don't even remember what that's supposed to be. But the second I see it every alarm in my brain goes off. I just know something bad is about to happen. </p>
                        <p>And their current conversation isn't making me feel any better about it.</p>
                        
                                <p>"But Al," Shiori says. "It's gonna be real magic. It's not a magic show!"</p>

                                <p>"I sure hope it isn't," I mutter. The closer we get to this 'ritual' the more of a
                                        bad feeling I get, now that I think about it. "Shiori, why do you care about the
                                        show so much?"</p>

                                <p>Shiori looks offended for a second, but then confused. As if she can't quite remember
                                        what she's supposed to be thinking and feeling. She whispers back to me: "I
                                        don't know... I just feel really drawn to it."</p>

                                <p>"Do you remember how it went?"</p>

                                <p>Shiori just stares at me blankly for a second. Then she squeezes her eyes real hard
                                        to try and remember, then tilts her head quizzically. "No... I don't."</p>

                                <p>I start feeling my chest tighten up real bad. Al, for his part, seems to notice.
                                        Though I guess from his perspective, it's just kids getting nervous about
                                        something that's new to them. So, he turns our attention to the town coming into
                                        view, as we turn a sharp corner.</p>

                                <p>There it is. Sussurokawa proper. "The real town," as opposed to the small slice of
                                        rich founder families on Rumeuri. </p>

                                <p>"Now Shiori, "It's just that all my years of wisdom have taught me how to live a good
                                        life with what's right in front of me. You see?"</p>

                                <p>Pastel buildings of wood and stone, and cobblestone streets lay before us. I can't
                                        help but notice we're not too far from the cliff where Shiori and I were looking
                                        at the lighthouse. But this vantage point is more modest. Lower to the ground.
                                        Not even quite looking down at the town, so much as seeing eye to eye with the
                                        tops of the shortest buildings. </p>

                                <p>I know they're not as close as they seem, but it almost feels like we could go
                                        hopping across the rooftops if we wanted. </p>

                                <p>"You know, when I was a younger man," Al says, stretching his arm out, "I used to
                                        spend all my time looking out at the misty waters. I wanted to know what was
                                        beyond the fog and horizon. "</p>

                                <p>"But what's that got to do with magic?"</p>

                                <p>"Hmm," Al strokes his beard as we start stepping into town finally. "I suppose all I
                                        mean to say is don't mind all the smoke and mirrors and you'll be just fine.
                                        Keep your feet on the ground."</p>

                                <p>He stamps his foot a few times demonstratively, before continuing. "All the magic and
                                        soothsaying in the world won't do you any good if you don't say grounded. Miss
                                        Shiori, Miss Mu, you ever hear about the sailor who could see the future?"</p>

                                <p>"Er, no?" I reply. "Could you not call me Miss M-</p>
                                <p>"Miss Moo!" Shiori chirps happily. Great.</p>

                                <p>"So, you've got this sailor fella who can see his own future. Great power for a
                                        sailor, isn't it? No matter what waves came his way, he could best them and
                                        stand tall. When they come, he sees the path through. <em>Before</em> they ever
                                        come, he already sees himself in their wake, completely unharmed. What do you
                                        think he sees?</p>

                                <p>
                                        "Treasure!" Shiori blurts out.

                                </p>
                                <p>
                                        "Well hell, knowledge <em>is</em> a kind of treasure. He looks to the future,
                                        and he sees himself alive and well in calm waters. Nothing to harm him! And in
                                        brashness and boldness, he thinks he's invincible. What do you think happens
                                        next?"

                                </p>
                                <p>
                                        "Umm, the wave gets him anyway?" I suggest, kind of lamely.

                                </p>
                                <p> "Well, he survives the storm just fine! Just like he imagined! But little did he
                                        know, that very storm had caused the currents to reverse! His boat stayed still
                                        in stagnant waters, and his nets caught no fish. He certainly was injured by no
                                        storm. Instead, he starved!" Al laughed. "Just goes to show sometimes you need a
                                        little more than magic to get through tough times."</p>

                                <p>
                                        "Oh..." Shiori looks a little saddened, which Al picks up on.

                                </p>
                                <p> "Now, how about I tell you all about how I escaped from Guantanamo Bay?"</p>

                                <p>Shiori nods excitedly, while I try not to look too doubtful. Did he? No. No way. I
                                        feel like he's making fun of us right now, and I try my best to disentangle my
                                        adult brain so I can ask myself if that makes any sense at all. It doesn't,
                                        right? That's too silly.</p>

                                <p>But, um... I suppose it couldn't hurt to hear him out. </p>

                                <hr>

                                <p>Sussurokawa Cove is a town that looks like it's been split in two. A stream of water
                                        runs right through the center, flowing off the hill, aided in its path to sea by
                                        the stony grand cascade. The bridge connects the two sides, but it's the town
                                        hall that seems to try and 'pull' the town together.</p>

                                <p>It's sort of scary looking, to be honest. The hall itself isn't anything special.
                                        Just bricks and wood, like any other building in town. But the grand cascade
                                        flows under it; which is to say the town hall is built <em>over</em> the
                                        cascade. I'm sure it's architecturally sound, but it sure looks precarious. And
                                        when I look at it from far away, I can't help but see the culvert where the
                                        water flows through as a smirking, open mouth, ready to eat up anything dumb
                                        enough to get near.</p>

                                <p>What I really can't help but notice is how diverse all the residents of Sussurokawa
                                        look. There's every skin tone, sure. But there are people as short as four feet,
                                        and as tall as seven; there are people with eyes so sharp they look like a
                                        hawk's, and people with ears so big they look like drawn caricatures. Everywhere
                                        I look are residents with remarkable physical traits. If there's anything that's
                                        kinda samey is that a lot of the residents seem a bit on the older side. But
                                        then again, Sussurokawa seems like the type of place older folk would flee to
                                        when they get tired of the world.</p>

                                <p> Here's someone with arms that look like steel girders. He seriously looks like he
                                        could lift a house. But he's wearing a baker's hat, and he gives me and Shiori a
                                        gentle wave.</p>

                                <p>"He makes really good empanadas, you know," Shiori says. </p>

                                <p>"I don't like empanadas because I hate raisins," I say.</p>

                                <p>"That's not good, Mu! You'll never grow tall like that."</p>

                                <p>It's a nice thought, thinking that maybe I could redo my whole growth process, set
                                        myself up on a path to be a good three or four inches taller than I was. As I'm
                                        idly thinking of lording over Shiori and maybe dunking a basketball on her, we
                                        get to the town hall where the ritual's supposed to be. And when I catch sight
                                        of a familiar set of statues, and a familiar tablet, I get the shudders.</p>

                                <p>There by the entrance of the town hall, is a statue of a man genuflecting in front of
                                        a woman. She's got his face in her hands, in a gesture somewhere between
                                        affection and clemency, and her own expression is one of soft benevolence. But
                                        when I look at the two statues, I feel nausea rising up from somewhere deep in
                                        me. </p>

                                <p>The tablet's even worse. The feeling goes beyond just an omen, because omens are
                                        warnings. They might be of supernatural origins, but at the end of the day,
                                        someone or something out there is saying "Hey! Watch out!" </p>

                                <p>But reading the tablet gives me a different feeling altogether. </p>

                                <p>I can't put my finger on why, but when I read it, it feels like someone out there is
                                        mocking me. That's the worst part. A benign face hiding bad intentions and real
                                        malice. Austere words covering something wriggling and gross. It's like
                                        somewhere in this town, there's someone who finds it a riot to throw worms in
                                        the spaghetti and watch everyone take a bite. And it feels like they're watching
                                        me right now. </p>
