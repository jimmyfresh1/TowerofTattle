                        <p>"Playing scholar for today, huh?" Al strokes his beard as he approaches. "You two have always struck me as smarter than other kids your age, that's true."</p>

                        <p>"Even me?" Shiori beams. "How come you're already awake, Al?"</p>

                        <p>"Especially you Shiori," he smiles. "And how could I not be? What, with all the arguing?"
                        </p> -->

                        <p>"O-oh. Sorry about that-" I start."</p>

                        <p>"No, no, I'm not talking about you two," he grumbles. "You'll see when you come down to eat. Come now. Oh, M, would you mind handing me those reading glasses?"</p>

                        <p>I silently nod and hand him some glasses that had been sitting on the corner of the desk, and Al starts making his way to the drawing room with a little more creak in his bones than usual. The second he's out of the study, though...I hear Shiori gasp behind me.</p>

                        <p>"Hey! Hey there!" Alexa <em>really</em> pops out of nowhere now, and I nearly scream in fright, when I feel her grab my shoulder out of nowhere. "Make sure you wash your hands, okay?"</p>

                        <p>"W-what? Okay, sure..." I say, feeling weirded out.</p>

                        <p>"You're about to eat after all. Never hurts to be safe!" Alexa says, before vanishing right before our eyes. </p>

                        <hr>





                        <hr>
<p>
                                "Hannah, I can't believe you are seriously talking about children when we're not even <em>dating.</em>"
        
</p>
<p>
                                "How? How can you say we're not dating when you've told me you loved me?!" Hannah screams. 
        
</p>
<p>
                                "I- I shouldn't have said tha-"
        
</p>
<p>
                                "Don't say another word, you brute! Don't take it back! I don't wanna hear it!" Hannah theatrically walks up to Nick just to slap him, before starting to dash out. But the door's so heavy, she struggles against it, and after a few seconds Nick sighs, walks over, and pushes it open the rest of the way for her. 
        
</p>                        
<p>
                                Then she gives him another light slap and runs off weepily. 
        
</p>
<p>
                                "Woah..." Shiori says.
        
</p>
<p>
                                "Nick, did you really say you loved her?" I eye him warily. 
        
</p>

        <p>So this is what people mean when they say someone's got a deer in the headlights look. He's just totally frozen. Seems like he's trying to figure out what to say, but all he can manage is to lamely point at some sandwiches all nicely wrapped on the table. </p>
<p>
                                Al just glares daggers into him. "What are you doing, you imbecile?! Chase after her for god's sake!"
</p>

        <p>"Right! You're right!" To his credit, that verbal slap on the back's all it takes, and Nick's out the door immediately. "Hannah! Hannah, come on!"</p>

        <p>In the wake of that whirlwind melodrama, there's not much left except silence and some tasty sandwiches. Al's got his hand to his temple with his eyes closed, as if he's got a pounding headache."That dumb bastard," Al growls. "Let's start heading to that magic show of yours, Miss Shiori. I need to stroll this vexation away."</p>

        <p>Still, vexed as he is, he still makes sure to pack the sandwiches Nick made.</p>

        <hr>

        <p>Leave it to kids to be nonplussed by adult drama. As we walk through the woods with Al, Shiori and I are engaged in a serious debate.</p>

        <p>"I always thought they were dating," Shiori says, mouth full of sandwich. </p>

        <p>"Huh? No way." It feels good to be a kid and just talk with my mouth full. Though, I don't think my mom would've let it fly. "You heard him. They're <em>not</em>dating. He said it over and over."</p> 

        <p>"Yeah, but that's just what people who are dating say sometimes!" Shiori retorts.</p>

        <p>"No, it's really not."</p>

        <p>"But they <em>love</em> each other!"</p>

        <p>"Huh? Is that really the impression you got?"</p>

        <p>"Yeah! Otherwise Nick would be some kind of... philanthropizing cod!"</p>

        <p>"...you mean, philandering cad?"</p>

        <p>Al, strolling ahead, seems a lot more put out by the whole thing. Honestly, I'm not sure why. If he hates Nick as much as he seems to, then it should be a good thing that Hannah seems to be reaching her limit with his wishy washiness.</p>

        <p>"Al, why do you hate Nick so much?" Shiori strolls up to Al and asks the quiet thing out loud.</p>

        <p>"Hmm," Al scratches his head, while slowing down to walk right next to her. He leans his stocky body over as if to literally lend her his ear. "Why, indeed?"</p>

        <p>"<em>Do</em> you actually hate him?" Shiori asks. I feel my own ears perk up in curiosity.</p>

        <p>"Catch me on a bad day," he grumbles, mostly to himself. "And I'd tell you I'd love nothing more for him to slip on pig dung and crack his head open. But I ought to be level-headed around you children. When I'm being fair, I'm as aware as anyone else I'm barkin' up the wrong tree with all this anger."</p>

        <p>Al sighs and rubs the back of his neck, before continuing on. "It just pains me to see a girl I love like a daughter to be so hopelessly infatuated and then be thrown about by the tides of love."</p>

        <p>Now I hop up to them to walk along. "Is Nick leading her on?"</p>

        <p>Al winces, seeming to think that's a bit too adult of a concept to come out of a child's mouth. "No, he's... he's got his reasons. Hannah's got some demons to conquer, you see. And it scares us all to think sometimes she... well, that she might not win. Sometimes it's easier to be angry than it is to be scared, Miss M, Miss Shiori. I hope when you're older the two of you'll know that doesn't make it right."</p>

        <p>Not much kids can say to that. We all just walk in silence for a while, each with our own objects to fidget with. Shiori's got Yorick. I've got the sandwiches in a basket. And Al's actually brought along a flashlight for when we walk back later, so he's making sure it works.</p>

        <p>"Al! Why'd you bring your reading glasses, anyway?" Shiori asks, breaking the silence.  </p>

<p>        "Oh, all the magic stuff isn't fun for a boring old man like me, anymore. I just figured I'd solve some crossword puzzles or somethin' while you two had fun."</p>

<p>
                "You like crossword puzzles?" Shiori asks.
        
</p>
<p>
                "That's right," he chuckles. "I bet you thought us sailors were dumb, huh?"
        
</p>
<p>
                "Never!"
        
</p>
<p>
                "Well, you're wise not to underestimate me Miss Shiori," Al grins. "I've been all over the world."
        
</p>
<p>
                "When?"
        
</p>
<p>        "Hell if I remember. All that's just a figment of the past nowadays. At this point, only thing I know's that Sussurokawa's got just about the worst sand I've ever set foot on."</p>

<p>        "Aw, but I like the sand here..." Shiori frowns. I feel a little offended too. I <em>also</em> like the sand here. But she keeps pestering him: "Where's the best sand in the world, then?"</p>

<p>
                "The Florida panhandle! But that doesn't mean you should ever go to Florida!"
        
</p>
<p>
                "Never! I won't!"</p>              

                <p>"Good girl," Al smiles, his good mood coming back fast. </p>

                <p>"But Al," Shiori says. "It's gonna be real magic. It's not a magic show!"</p>

                <p>"I sure hope it isn't," I mutter. The closer we get to this 'ritual' the more of a bad feeling I get, now that I think about it. "Shiori, why do you care about the show so much?"</p>

                <p>Shiori looks offended for a second, but then confused. As if she can't quite remember what she's supposed to be thinking and feeling. She whispers back to me: "I don't know... I just feel really drawn to it."</p>

                <p>"Do you remember how it went?"</p>

                <p>Shiori just stares at me blankly for a second. Then she squeezes her eyes real hard to try and remember, then tilts her head quizzically. "No... I don't."</p>

                <p>I start feeling my chest tighten up real bad. Al, for his part, seems to notice. Though I guess from his perspective, it's just kids getting nervous about something that's new to them. So, he turns our attention to the town coming into view, as we turn a sharp corner.</p>

                <p>"Now Shiori, it's not that I don't <em>believe</em> in magic," he says. "It's just that all my years of wisdom have taught me how to live a good life with what's right in front of me. You see?"</p>

                <p>Pastel buildings of wood and stone, and cobblestone streets lay before us. I can't help but notice we're not too far from the cliff where Shiori and I were looking at the lighthouse. But we're at  more modest vantage point, lower to the ground. Not even quite looking down at the town, so much as standing at eye level with the tops of the shortest buildings.</p>

                <p>We've still got a bit to go, but the curve of the hill makes it feel like we could just go jumping across the houses if we wanted to.</p>

                <p>"You know, when I was a younger man," Al says, stretching his arm out, "I used to spend all my time looking out at the misty waters. I wanted to know what was beyond the fog and horizon. Nowadays, though... I like to look at the town. At some point, I got all that adventure out of me."</p>

                <p>"But what's that got to do with magic?"</p>

                <p>"Well, lemme tell you an old sailor's tale. It's about a man who had what those fortune tellers you like have: the power to see the future. So, here's a sailor who can best any wave, no matter how great. When they waves come, he sees the path through. <em>Before</em> the waves ever come, he sees himself standing tall in their wake unharmed. So, one day, before a great storm he sets off. What do you think he sees?</p>

<p>
                        "What?"
        
</p>
<p>
                        "He looks to the future, and he sees himself alive and well in calm waters. Nothing to harm him! And in brashness and boldness, he thinks he's invincible. What do you think happens next?"
        
</p>
<p>
                        "What?"
        
</p>
<p>                "Well, he survives the storm just fine! Just like he imagined! But little did he know, had caused the currents to reverse! His boat stayed still in stagnant waters, and his nets caught no fish. He certainly was injured by no storm. Instead, he starved!" Al laughed. "Just goes to show sometimes you need a little more than magic to get through tough times."</p>

<p>
                        "Oh..." Shiori looks a little saddened, which Al picks up on.
        
</p>
<p>                "Now, how about I tell you all about how I escaped from Guantanamo Bay?"</p>

                <p>Shiori nods excitedly, while I try not to look too doubtful. Did he? No. No way. I feel like he's making fun of us right now, and I try my best to disentangle my adult brain so I can ask myself if that makes any sense at all. It doesn't, right? That's too silly.</p>

                <p>But, um... I suppose it couldn't hurt to hear him out. </p>
