                        <p>        "Stop just popping out like that!" I sigh. "Can't you make The Codex glow whenever you come out?"</p>

                        <p>        "Sorry!" Again Alexa tilts her head cutely and sticks her tongue out. 'Teehee!' I want to say it's annoying, but there's something comforting about it. </p>

                        <p>"Hmm, seems like it's going off the most... ah! Seriously? Around the children's books?" I
                                pull a single book off the shelf -- the one that seems to be making The Codex go
                                absolutely wild. </p>

                                There's a cute green eyed bunny on the cover, looking like it's getting ready to board a
                                train, all nervous and excited. I open up to the front matter and see that there's a
                                note there. Oh?

                        </p>

                        <p>I guess she was planning to give me this as a gift. I don't really know how to respond,
                                honestly. I feel the slightest twinge of sadness, but I also met these people just
                                today. At least... from my perspective. And them... technically they don't even
                                <em>have</em> a perspective right now. The disconnect between it all is making my head
                                hurt.</p>

                        <p>"That's really nice," Shiori says softly.</p>

                        <p>Looks like this page Hannah's written on is the telltail snitch, because the page rips itself
                                from the book with the usual ceremony, and does the usual rigamarole of joining its
                                friends in The Codex.</p>

                                        Today a new girl came to town. I've never seen anyone as young as me. She's
                                        pretty. But I feel bad for her because she has to stay with Monika. No one in
                                        town likes Monika. I think she's Monika's niece.
                                        <br><br>
                                        I don't know if we'll be friends, because she seems kind of baby-ish. I don't
                                        think she could take care of herself if she had to survive in the wilderness,
                                        for example, or had to do taxes. I don't exactly know how to do taxes, but I
                                        know enough about it that I'm sure I could. And I could probably survive in the
                                        wild for about two months.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Everyone in town likes her, especially everyone important on Rumeuri Hill. I
                                        think that's good. She's a good kid. I'm a good child, too, but not in the way
                                        that's fun for adults. They worry about me more than they have fun with me.

                                        Shiori's a good kid, like I said last time. She has fun like a normal kid and
                                        laughs like a normal kid, and I think that mkes all the adults happy. I'm glad
                                        she's around for them, so they can have fun like normal adults looking at
                                        sunsets and smelling flowers and all that stuff I can't stand.
                                        <br><br>
                                        But today she really upset me so I let her know very maturely that she shouldn't
                                        act like a know-it-all. Yes, I knew they were moths and not butterflies. I made
                                        sure to explain my point again, very maturely. I was very cordial about it.

                        <p>Ugh. Shiori is staring at me. Hard. Seriously, she's about to burn a hole right through me,
                                and it's all I can do to not hang my head in shame.</p>

                        <p>"Wh-why would you even lie to your diary?" she asks.</p>

                        <p>I don't know. I just don't know. Are the rest of my journal entries just going to be a
                                greatest hits of kid shame collection? </p>

                                        Sometimes right when it gets dark I feel so sad and empty. I don't know why. I hate it but maybe I don't. Lately, I don't even really feel sad. I just don't feel anything. 
                                        <br><br>
                                        I tried to ask mom about it but she just looked bewildered and said maybe we could talk to Kyrie about it. I think she hates the idea of being helped by Kyrie though. Does my mom hate psycholigists? I don't know. I don't know how much mom likes anything exept working. 


                                </div>
                        </div>

                        <p>Ouch. That's kind of heavy. It's supposed to be <em>me</em> but all I can think is 'wow, that's really heavy.' Frankly, the searing hot shame of my other entries made me feel a bit more connected. Reading this, it feels like some other sad little kid wrote it. But Shiori looks absolutely devastated reading it. </p>

                        <p>Well... no. One thing hits home, right in the hippocampus. The bewildered look. The one my mom always gave me. It's flashing through my head, all the times I'd come to her with something... at this point I don't even know what <em>specifically</em>. Just that, you know, if I felt sad, she'd give me this confused look, like she had no idea what to do. And if I couldn't do something, it was like she couldn't understand not being able to do it.  It always seemed like she could do anything in the world, as long as it didn't involve me.</p>

                        <p>It was like the only thing she wasn't great at was being a mom. Like she avoided it sometimes because she couldn't handle not being the best at something.</p>

<p>                        Now that I think about it, maybe that's why I was so childishly infatuated with maturity and capability. I must have just been trying my best to imitate my mom. Still, I can't help but feel like there was something else to it... Ugh. Seriously though, did I actually think I could survive in the wild for two months?</p>

                        <p>"You always were talking about 'taxes' and 'finances' and 'economics' for some reason. You know, for a little kid you were really obsessed with money management. Like here!" Shiori gets on her tip toes to grab a huge book off the shelf. "You always lugged this book around! Like you were actually reading it!"</p>

                        <p>Shiori flips it open to a random page.</p>

                        <p><u><strong>Fiscal Policy in an Increasingly Globalized World: Strategy for Competing with Multinationals</strong></u></p>

                        <p id="quote2">Foreign Direct Investment is not simply the purview of monolithic multinationals. FDI constitutes and facilitates the economy of the modern world. As the world enters the 21st century, markets can no longer be considered lakes and ponds with no crossover or spillage. Firms that choose to engage in FDI enter a complex net of regulatory frameworks, whereby red tape can either entrap a firm into needless litigation, or be cut through so long as the firm offers the promise of innovation that the recipient country can absorb, adapt, and diffuse. The national firm operates within the strict lines of 'law', but the international firm must gracefully navigate culture and institutions. Investment deals with lead negotiation times of years up to a full decade are can be reneged upon simply because the firm stepped on the wrong toes. But parochialism can be to your firm's advantage, so long as...</p>

                        <p>"Y-yeah. I totally understand what this page is saying."</p>

                        <p>"Explain it then!"</p>

                        <p>"What am I, a monkey? It's rude to ask your friends to show off like that."</p>

                        <p>"O-oh. You're right. Sorry..." Shiori casts her eyes downward.</p>

                        <p>"Don't sweat it," I say, though I'm the one sweating it. "Hey, listen to that! The Codex is still rustling!"</p>

                        <p>In a situation like this the best course of action is to keep charging forward. </p>
