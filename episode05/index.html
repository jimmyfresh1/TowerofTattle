    <p>"Wow," Shiori said. "I knew you were the kind of girl who'd keep a diary, but I didn't know you'd write such cute dumb things!"</p>

    <p>"I was probably like six, okay?!" I want to slap her, but I know she's speaking without a hint of malice. "Let's go find the next entry where I'm like... eight!</p>

    <p>"You were so cute as a kid, M!" Shiori chirps happily. A small happy feeling pops up in my chest, at how happy she is to at least give me a nickname. "M," huh? It looked like my name had eight letters? Madeline? Meredith? Oh god, it's not Mildred, is it?</p>

    <p>"She was cute, wasn't she?"</p> 

    <p>A new voice interjects.</p>

    <p>"Look, can we stop talking about it?" I'm blushing hard. I don't mind being called cute, but I think 'my daddy must have been a prince!' is a whole other level. "Wait... AHHH!</p>

    <p>"Yeah!" Shiori bubbles again. "Super cute! Wait, wha- AHHH!"</p>

    <p>Both of us yelp at the new girl interpolated between us. It was so sudden, it must have been magical, and at this point 'magical' is just about the thing I least trust in this world. I barely resist the urge to just push the girl down and grab Shiori and run. In fact, that's exactly what I would have done, but something in her demeanor so strongly gives off harmlessness that I hesitate.</p>

    <p>"Erm. Who are you?" I ask cautiously.</p>

    <p>"I'm Alexa," she says smoothly and brightly. As if that tells us anything.</p>

    <p>"You know, that doesn't really help," I respond.</p>

    <p>"I'm Alexa, and you can think of me as your <em>assistant.</em>" She points to the Codex in my hands. "I'm part of the Codex. I'm here to help you and point you in the right direction."</p>

    <p>"An assistant named... Alexa..." Shiori suddenly gasps. "Alexa! What's the name of the sandwich with way too much olive?!" </p>
    
    <p> I have no idea what Shiori's doing.</p>

    <p>"That would be a muffaletta," Alexa replies.</p>

    <p>Huh?</p>

    <p>"She's like! Um!" Shiori is now excitedly prodding me in the crook of my elbow, till I have to slap her hand away 'cause it kinda hurts. "She's like a, um! Well, you've never seen one! And that makes me kinda sad... but she's like an AI assistant!"</p>

    <p>"Like the NPCs?"</p>

        <p>"Kind of! But not really! Like, we can Google things with her!"</p>

        <p>"We can what with her?"</p>

        <p>"It's a thing that you'd totally get once you saw it!" Shiori says with a bizarre mix of sadness and loudness, all the while now hopping up and down. Um, for some reason, seeing her hop like that makes me kind of want to jump up and down on my bed. "Like -- like a super encyclopedia! I bet she can help us find the other journals!"</p>

        <p>Well, that <em>does</em> sound useful. I still don't feel great about it though, and start eyeing the supposedly serendipitous interloper up and down. </p>

    <p>Green's the first thing that jumps out at me. A cute green beret, and a cute green oversized sweater, with sleeves that are <em>just</em> too long. Hair on the sandier side of blonde, barely above the shoulders but still fluffy.  Stunningly pale eyes.  Washed out jeans, tapered and skinny almost like capris. She looks like she just popped out of The Breakfast Club.</p>

    <p>She's older than us, too, but maybe not quite an adult. It's embarrassing, but if we were a few years younger, to anyone looking at us from the outside it'd look like she was our babysitter. </p>


    <p>"It's hard to imagine her even swatting a fly, the way her fingers barely poke out of the sweater sleeves. Not to mention her confident, thousand-watt smile that would give even Shiori's sunshine beaming face a run for its money."</p>
