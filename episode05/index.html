    <p>"Wow," Shiori said. "I knew you were the kind of girl who'd keep a diary, but I didn't know you'd write such cute dumb things!"</p>

    <p>"I was probably like six, okay?!" I want to slap her, but I know she's speaking without a hint of malice. "Let's go find the next entry where I'm like... eight!</p>

    <p>"You were so cute as a kid, M!" Shiori chirps happily. A small happy feeling pops up in my chest, at how happy she is to at least give me a nickname. "M," huh? It looked like my name had eight letters? Madeline? Meredith? Oh god, it's not Milldred, is it?</p>

    <p>"She was cute, wasn't she?"</p> 

    <p>A new voice interjects.</p>

    <p>"Look, can we stop talking about it?" I'm blushing hard. I don't mind being called cute, but I think 'my daddy must have been a prince!' is a whole other level. "Wait... AHHH!</p>

    <p>"Yeah!" Shiori bubbles again. "Super cute! Wait, wha- AHHH!"</p>

    <p>Both of us yelp at the new girl interpolated between us. It was so sudden, it must have been magical, and at this point 'magical' is just about the thing I least trust in this world. I barely resist the urge to just push the girl down and grab Shiori and run. In fact, that's exactly what I would have done, but something in her demeanor so strongly gives off harmlessness that I hesitate.</p>

    <p>"Erm. Who are you?" I ask cautiously.</p>

    <p>"I'm Alexa," she says smoothly and brightly. As if that tells us anything.</p>

    <p>"You know, that doesn't really help," I respond.</p>

    <p>"I'm Alexa, and you can think of me as your <em>assistant.</em>" She points to the Codex in my hands. "I'm part of the Codex. I'm here to help you and point you in the right direction."</p>

    <p>"An assistant named... Alexa..." Shiori suddenly gasps. "Alexa! What's the name of the sandwich with way too much olive?!" </p>
    
    <p> I have no idea what Shiori's doing.</p>

    <p>"That would be a muffaletta," Alexa replies.</p>

    <p>Huh?</p>

    <p>"She's like! Um!" Shiori is now excitedly prodding me in the crook of my elbow, till I have to slap her hand away 'cause it kinda hurts. "She's like a, um! Well, you've never seen one! And that makes me kinda sad... but she's like an AI assistant!"</p>

    <p>"Like the NPCs?"</p>

        <p>"Kind of! But not really! Like, we can Google things with her!"</p>

        <p>"We can what with her?"</p>

        <p>"It's a thing that you'd totally get once you saw it!" Shiori says with a bizarre mix of sadness and loudness, all the while now hopping up and down. Um, for some reason, seeing her hop like that makes me kind of want to jump up and down on my bed. "Like -- like a super encyclopedia! I bet she can help us find the other journals!"</p>

        <p>Well, that <em>does</em> sound useful. I still don't feel great about it though, and start eyeing the supposedly serendipitous interloper up and down. </p>

    <p>Green's the first thing that jumps out at me. A cute green beret, and a cute green oversized sweater, with sleeves that are <em>just</em> too long. Hair on the sandier side of blonde, barely above the shoulders but still fluffy.  Stunningly pale eyes.  Washed out jeans, tapered and skinny almost like capris. She looks like she just popped out of The Breakfast Club.</p>

    <p>She's older than us, too, but maybe not quite an adult. It's embarrassing, but if we were a few years younger, to anyone looking at us from the outside it'd look like she was our babysitter. It's hard to imagine her even swatting a fly, the way her fingers barely poke out of the sweater sleeves. Not to mention her confident, thousand-watt smile that would give even Shiori's sunshine beaming face a run for its money.</p>

    <p>"I'm here, to help <em>you.</em> So help me help you, yeah? What's the phrase? I'm all that and a bag of chips?" Alexa said with far too much smugness.</p>

    <p>"Alexa! Where'd I lose my phone?" Shiori asks excitedly.</p>

    <p>"A phone? How can you possibly lose your phone? Aren't they... well no, maybe in the present... " Alexa frowns, before being caught by the glimmer in Shiori's eyes. "It's probably under your bed."</p>

    <p> "It usually <em>is</em> under my bed!</p>

    <p>"I bet you put it in your fridge once, too."</p>

    <p>"I <em>did,</em> Shiori gasps.</p>

    <p>"That's really not -- " I stop, not really wanting to take the wind out of Shiori's sails. "Okay, look Alexa. I'm not as easy to impress. And we're doing something important. So, go on. Impress me so I can be sure you won't get in our way."</p>

    <p>"I know that you wouldn't sleep alone in your room until you were eight, and needed three nightlights until you were nine. And -- "</p>

    <p>"STOP! Stop that sentence right there! Is everyone and everything in this Tower conspiring to expose embarrassing moments for me?!</p>

    <p>"Well, you have a <em>lot</em>," Shiori says, with unearned smugness.</p>

    <p>"Why do you know that?" I demand </p>

    <p>"We're intimately related, you and I. You and this Codex. You and <em> this Vault. </em> I'm here to help you fulfill your destiny. Which starts with you reclaiming your name. "Alexa takes the Codex from me, with a tilt of her head and a smile like the world's most charming concierge, and she begins flipping through the pages."Ouch!"</p>

    <p>She opens the page up to my diary, still displaying a barely begun game of hangman. 'MÀçÀçÀçÀçÀçÀçÀç.' I can't help but notice she's given herself a papercut in the process, and her smile takes on this little hint of chagrin, as she sticks her tongue out playfully. 'Oops! I cut myself!' Again, the harmlessness is just emanating off of her like warmth off a fireplace. But I can't help but think it looks a little ominous the way a bit of blood smudges next to my name. </p>
