<p>
                        "What were you thinking, Al? Did you not stop to think for two seconds?" 
        
</p>
<p>
                        Looks like my mom won't be satisfied without dressing Al down even more. Though at this point, apologetic as he is, he seems a bit bored of it and like he's just nodding along. Actually, more than anything he looks tired. It's easy to forget he really is an old man. 
        
</p>
<p>
                        "Sorry... thought it was a magic show," he mumbles, and the nodding along is starting to turn into nodding off.
        
</p>
<p>                Meanwhile, Shiori's fallen completely asleep with her head on Al's shoulder. She actually sleeps pretty quietly, listening to her now. But every so often she lets out a small whimper, and I can't help but feel sorry. </p>

<p>                "I just don't know what to do, Al," my mom mutters, though by now even she knows she's just talking to herself. "Can I even trust you with the kids anymore?"</p>
                
<p>                "Maybe if you'd been paying attention to us, you would've stopped us from going yourself," I say a bit icily. I can't help myself. </p>
                
<p>
                        "Maybe you're right."
        
</p>
<p>                She says it in such a straightforward tone that I didn't really expect. And after that, besides the sound of the car rolling over cobblestone, everything's silent. It actually hurts a little more that she just agreed with me. But I'm not bothered by it. </p>

<p>                Muto Pagetta, the sheriff, just keeps driving along silent as ever. Surprisingly, we're driving away from Rumueri Hill, but we're still driving into the woods. I must not have gone here much before, because I'm surprised that we start passing by trailer homes. I guess even Sussurokawa's got its "other half."</p>

<p>                My mom did say we "have to stop somewhere first" but I didn't expect it to be the sheriff's house. We pull into a gravel driveway, and the automatic light above the trailer's front door pops on just as we park. Unexpectedly, as Muto steps out of the car, so does my mom.</p>

<p>
                        "Just wait here a moment M... Mu," my mom says.
        
</p>
<p>                "No. I want to come in." This is as good a place to start practicing my new strategy of proactiveness. My mom raises an eyebrow and pauses for a good long while, but...</p> 

<p>
                        "Suit yourself."
        
</p>                
<p>
                        Weird that she didn't even stop to ask Muto. I get that there's no way he'd say no, but isn't that a little rude?
        
</p>
<p>                Honestly? Muto doesn't exactly look crazy about being home. Yeah, he looks stoic all the time, but now his steps have that extra 'trudge' to them. Maybe it'd be more accurate to say he doesn't <em>sound</em> crazy to be home, the way his feet drag ever so slightly against gravel, the way he has to lug himself up every step of the unvarnished deck</p>

<p>
                        Muto unlocks the front door, and I almost sneeze from the smell of incense.
        
</p>
<p>                I don't know what I expected from a sheriff's home, except that it would probably be at least tasteful, and, for the most part, that's true for Muto's place. It's clean and restrained. For the most part. </p>

<p>                I can't help but notice lately that wood really does tell the tale. Most of the furniture looks like pine to me. A bit scratched up and used... maybe even secondhand. I'm not an expert, but I'm pretty sure the floor is pine, too. Normally you'd expect carpet or linoleum, or at least fake wood, but I step onto it and the way the sound rings out I just know. </p>

<p>                There's oak too, just like my house, but it's reserved for a couple of important pieces of furniture. The first is a desk, probably Muto's, in the corner of the trailer right by the entrance to a small hallway -- which definitely leads to bedrooms. And the second is a huge bookshelf right across from where we came in.</p>

<p>                And that's the big sore thumb. The bookshelf takes about as much of the long wall as it can. And it's filled to the brim with occult crap. There's a whole shelf with nothing but crystals on it. A vaguely alchemical looking chalice with obtuse symbols lords over the top shelf, centered on an altar cloth which is hanging off a bit. Books with tarot trumps on the spine, or astrological signs, or evil malicious looking eyes all compete for shelf space.</p>

<p>                It's like all the eccentric got quarantined to one shelf. I get the vibe that this home is one bad day away from pentagrams finally taking over the whole place and just ruining the interior decorating. Plus, I hate to say it, it's pretty clear whose bad day would tip the trailer home's balance into complete occultism.</p>

<p>                She's sitting right at the dining table engrossed in a book right now. I guess from here I can't really see <em>what</em> she's reading, but the fixation on her face and creepy smile doesn't exactly scream med student to me. She hardly looks up at her husband and nods, pointing to some cold dinner sitting on the counter. </p>

<p>It's Prima Pagetta. The woman who disappeared before the murders... and came back after Sussurokawa Cove was already wispier than a myth -- a town entirely and unceremoniously forgotten.  </p>

<p>
                        "Sorry. I would've made more if I knew people were coming."
        
</p>
<p>
                        She doesn't even look at us. 
        
</p>
<p>
                        "Prima."
        
</p>
<p>
                        Surprisingly, it's not Muto who speaks to her first, but my mom. I can swear I see Muto's eyes narrow a bit, and he tactfully puts a hand on my back to direct me around to his desk, while he starts looking through it.
        
</p>
<p>
                        "Yes, Lessie?"
        
</p>
<p>
                        "Don't call me, Lessie. I don't like when you act too familiar with me."
        
</p>
<p>                There's a lot of weird energy in the air right now, and it's not from the moon, quicksilver, or Satan. I hear Muto's tongue click -- for him, a dramatic expression of emotion -- and I suddenly remember that my mom does <em>not</em> usually care what people call her, because I know I've heard random workers around the house call her Lessie.</p>
<p>
        
                        "Lessie," the woman looks up slowly, and completely ignores the imperative. "How was the meeting of the Order of Light? Did you learn anything about magecraft today?"
</p>

<p>
                        Huh? Magecraft? 
        
</p>
<p>
                        "Prima," my mom says, a hand rising to her forehead and a vein throbbing in her temple. "This cult is getting dangerous. The town feels like it's going to be swept by it any day now. I need to crack down on it. Do you understand?"
        
</p>
<p>
                        "Sure," Prima says amiably. "Why not?"
        
</p>
<p>                Prima is a really creepy woman. Though, maybe even more jarring than Prima herself is the way she seems to get under my mom's skin. I can't help but think there's something a little... childish about the way my mom seems to need control of this conversation.</p>

<p>
                        "That's why I can't have the wife of the town's sheriff participating as a member of that cult. None of us have the time to deal with you harassing us. Muto doesn't have the time to deal with you harassing <em>him.</em>"
        
</p>
<p>
                        "I'd say you're the one harassing me right now."
        
</p>                

        <p>"Are you kidding me, Prima? You're really going to pretend a few candid words are as bad as you killing small animals and hanging them around town? Putting disgusting fluids in people's meals?" </p>

        <p>I tug at Muto's sleeve. "Um... I probably shouldn't be saying this. But is it really fine for you to just stand by while my mom yells at your wife?"</p>

                
        <p>   Muto just stays silent. He pulls out the desk's pencil drawer, feeling around for a while before finally grasping something. From what I can tell, he had something taped to the top of the drawer, and sure enough, he pulls out a key. Then he crouches down and with a bit of a groan reaches toward the back of the desk, again feeling for something. And yet again, he pulls out a key. </p>

        <p>Prima's stare never breaks, nor her smile. "Lessie, right now you're in mine and Muto's home. You should calm down."</p>

        <p>"I'm perfectly calm you crazy bitch!" my mom snaps, and I flinch instinctively. She tries to take a few soothing breaths and continues: "...What I'm trying to say nicely, Prima, is that you can do all your occult bullshit as much as you'd like <em>after</em> we deal with this. I <em>need</em> a way to arrest the cult leader without the town rioting."
        
</p>
<p>
                        Prima just shrugs, and I'm pretty sure I can see  It's effortless psychological attrition.  If I ever thought I wanted to see my mom thoroughly helpless and on the back foot, I was wrong. This is deeply, primally unpleasant. 
        
</p>
<p>
                        Though her voice quiets a shade, my mom's eyes only get darker, and I see the slightest tremor in her lips. "Prima, do you not understand that you're putting your husband in danger? Do you realize we have four measily officers to protect a town of 1000 people?"
        
</p>
<p>
                        Prima giggles scornfully. "Are you really calling it protecting us?"
        
</p>
<p>
                        This is getting really bad. </p>

<p>
                        Meanwhile, my mom's voice is getting louder and louder, and Prima's voice is getting more derisive. 
        
</p>
<p>
                        But Muto just again takes me tactfully and walks me over to the hallway, and into one of the bedrooms. The door stays open, and so the yelling doesn't get quieter. So I'm not sure how much better this really is. But I guess in here we can try our best to pretend. 
        
</p>
<p>
                        Now here's a room that looks it's been left untouched for ages. That doesn't mean it's not striking, though. Looking around, I'm shocked how much a simple change of color can almost bring you into a different world. </p>
                        
<p>
                                Almost.
        
</p>                        
                        <p>With walls somewhere around cerulean, even this small cramped space can look like the open sky. The touch of an amateur hand is there, the slightly uneven paint, the noticeable but not wild drips and streaks. It looks like the work of someone who did a good job -- for a first job. Someone who worked painstakingly even if they didn't have a perfect handle on it. Someone who really cared. </p>
                        
        <p>                It makes me think that someone lived in this room, in this trailer, some long time ago, and wished they could escape. So they tried to will their small little slice of the world into a sanctuary. Dreaming of somewhere else, they painted their walls as blue as the sky. But they could never fully escape, because those very same walls were thin like the air. 
        
</p>
                
        <p>"Who's... room is this, Officer Pagetta?"</p>
                
        <p>"Just call me Muto," he says. Not quite the gruff voice I was expecting. It comes out sounding deep, clear, and surprisingly thoughtful. "Or Mr. Pagetta's fine if you're uncomfortable."</p>

        <p>"...Officer Pagetta."</p>

        <p>"It's a room that used to belong to my daughter. My daughter who went missing. Now it's... a place to store certain things." </p>

        <p>"...Missing with... all the other children?" I ask. </p>
        
        <p>He actually looks me in the eye now. </p>
        
        <p>I'd pegged him as just the stoic type, but thinking about it, he's almost actively avoidant of eye contact. So, now that he's looking at me straight on, it makes his gaze more meaningful. It seems like he's about to say something before he just looks away and moves purposefully to the far corner of the room. Seems like Muto's stuff always gets pushed to one corner or another. </p>

        <p>There's basically only three things in this room. There's a bed with a plain white pillow, and plain white sheets. As nondescript and anonymous as it gets. Then there's a short bookshelf of pine that looks <em>really</em> hand-me-down, almost like it's gonna fall apart, and even though it barely comes to my waist the shelves are low occupancy. </p>

        <p>Then there's a gun safe.</p>

        <p>Muto's opening that up instead of answering me. I can't help but politely look away when he puts in his combination -- not that I'd ever steal a frickin' police officer's gun -- and by the time I look back, he's already unlocking it with the two keys he got from his desk earlier. Then, amazingly, he pulls out his wallet, and from it <em>another</em> key.</p>

        <p>"You... really don't trust your wife, do you?"</p>

        <p>"Not with a gun, I don't. Would you?"</p>

        <p>"Nuh uh. No way. Never."</p>

        <p>At that, he just nods. And now he's examining the gun he pulled from it, reflexively checking to make sure it's not loaded. He stares at it a while, mulling something over, before placing it back. Instead, he brings out a taser. And a can of mace.</p>

        <p>I don't think he minds, but the longer I look at an old guy handling lethal weapons, the more I feel like it's weird for me to look. And barely, just barely, I pick up on something with my ears from the bookshelf anyway. So, I tip toe there nonchalantly.</p>

        <p>There's only enough books to halfway fill the top shelf. A book on bushcraft. A book on saving money. A psychology book. A book on electronics. These are the kinds of worn down books sitting there. Muto's daughter, imagined or not, must have been extremely practical.</p>

        <p><u><strong>'The Design of Everyday Things'</strong></u></p>
        <p><u><strong>'Bullfinch's Mythology'</strong></u></p>

        <p><u><strong>'What's What? A Physical Glossary of the Real World'</strong></u></p>

        <p>It's from the very last one there that I hear the rustling. And when I surreptitiously open the book, the snitch inside flips its small paper bird head toward me, absolutely shocked, like I caught it sleeping. This one's small. Real small. With thin wings miraculously <em>vibrating</em> more than just flapping, I realize this one's a hummingbird. And it's zipping around the room, then out, away from me, because apparently the last thing it wants is to be caught.</p>

        <p>Wait. That's bad.</p>

        <p>"Um! I'm gonna check on my mom!" I blurt out, trying to rush into the trailer's den as unsuspiciously as possible. </p>

        <p>Zip. Zip. Zip. My eyes flutter around trying to catch fluttering wings, and the snitch zips around trying in futility to zip completely out of sight. There's nowhere for it to go in this small trailer, and it keeps banging into things. Into the cream colored wallpaper, into a gaudy glowing heavy slab of quartz on the shelf, into the closed-shut front door over and over and over hoping to escape into the cold night air. I'd feel sorry for it, except that the stupid, anxious thing's frenetic flight also happens to be pulling <em>me</em> into its turbulence.  </p>

        <p>Because almost the second I walk out, I watch the book Prima was reading fly right across the trailer, crashing into a cupboard and clattering, maybe breaking the dishes within. Even the creepy, obnoxious, unflappable Prima looks shocked.</p>

        <p>Somehow Muto, walking into the den as quiet as ever, is the only one not shocked. My mom's shocked at herself. Prima's trembling. My eyes are darting just about everywhere.</p>

        <p>"That's enough, Lessia." Muto's voice doesn't sound any harsher than usual. But it comes out as clear as normal -- and that's its own kind of poise. </p>

        <p>"I'm sorry. That was uncalled for," my mom says, with a shaking voice... but a cold voice. "But I want to hear it right from your mouth Prima. Say you're not going to participate in any more of these stupid games."</p>

        <p>"...sure. Whatever you say little miss tyrant. I won't participate." Prima spits the words out with more than a little disgust. </p>

        <p>She sounds extraordinarily tired as she says it. And for a moment, she really does just look like an old woman way past her prime, tired of being threatened and harried by someone younger. I desperately don't want to notice it, but I can see it in the twitchy way she sneers. Prima's afraid.</p>

        <p>Right then my mom wasn't just mean, or domineering, or strict. She looked vicious. She was scary.</p>

        <p>She scared me.</p>

        <hr>
        <hr>

        <p>On the way out of Muto's place, I discreetly caught the snitch between the pages of The Codex the way you squish a mosquito with a clap. The snitch must have lost all its energy listening to that fight too, because it hardly even tried to buzz away.  </p>

        <p>I'll look at it tomorrow.</p>

        <p>The cruiser's still warm and running when we get in, which is enough to keep Al and Shiori dozing away even when the cabin light briefly pops on. A few bleary blinks from Shiori maybe, and a few groans, but the second they're off she's back to sleep again, and we're rolling back out of the gravel driveway.</p>

        <p>As for me, the stress and nervous energy's keeping me going. I've been exhausted all day. I'm still exhausted. But you could throw me into a cozy bed right now and I doubt I'd get any sleep. And it's one unpleasant feeling after another, because as we keep cruising deeper through dark, rural roads, I realize we're headed to Monika to drop Shiori off.</p>

        <p>...Actually, this might be really bad. What happens if we get separated? No. No... that's not the issue right now. Even if Monika's some kind of robot right now, she's an evil robot. I don't want to leave Shiori with her. Ever. But for some reason those stupid kid emotions start coming in. The kind where you can't bring yourself to ask something because you know they'll say no. </p>

        <p>"M-mom. Do we have to drop Shi-"</p>

        <p>"We do."</p>

        <p>"Why?!"</p>

        <p>"It's not like I feel good about it," my mom says looking back with that half-apologetic face I hate. "But... we can't just <em>kidnap</em> her."</p>

        <p>"B-but you know it's the right thing to do!"</p>

        <p>"It's not the <em>legal</em> thing to do.</p>

        <p>"Mom!"</p>

        <p>When I hear Shiori stirring beside me, I instantly regret how I'm so stupidly incapable of not getting pulled into the pace of mother and daughter. She must have basically gotten the picture, because she doesn't do much but keep blinking, with eyes barely open. Just a look that says she's used to it. Which means she's back in it -- that mental and emotional space she was when she was really this age. Just... your typical, everyday despair. </p>

        <p>That's when I resolve myself.</p>

        <p>"Shiori," I really <em>really</em> try to whisper softly, and this time I'm literally right in her ear no matter how stupid it looks when my mom can just watch us conspire through the rearview mirror. "Let's run away tonight."</p>

        <p>"H-huh? That's crazy M... Mu," Shiori says in sleepy, sad tones. "I'll find you tomorrow. It's okay."</p>

        <p>I can almost hear my mom's eyebrows raising.</p>

        <p>Shiori gives me a pretty, fake smile. The first smile all night, and it's a despairing one. My head starts running through the scenarios to sneak out at night, and go get her, but I don't know if I could walk this far, um, maybe if I rode my bike? We have a car we never use, but I don't know where my mom hides the keys... wait, that's a really stupid idea. </p>

        <p>What happens if I die in here?</p>

        <p>We arrive, before I can work out any more details of what was definitely going to be a bad plan. Muto pulls the cruiser up to the curb of a small house that looks quaint and peaceful in the cold and cricketing night. And...</p>

        <p>"Monika's car isnt here," my mom with a cold, quiet voice.</p>

        <p>"A lot of nights she's not home," Shiori says, still with her fake smile. "T-thank you for dropping me off."</p>

        <p>Shiori says that but she freezes up there for a moment, just silently hugging Yorick. I hear her take in a ragged breath, and let out a ragged sigh, and in the quiet moments that follow, just when it seems like she's emotionally prepared herself to go in, my mom speaks up.</p>

        <p>"We can't just leave you alone in an empty house, Shiori. Go get some clothes."</p>

        <p>Shiori immediately perks up.</p>

        <p>"Okay! I'll be right back!" She yells it so loud Al momentarily wakes up in a fluster and whips his head around like he's in a fight. </p>

        <p>She basically jumps across me to open up the car door, and flies out in a rush, probably afraid that Monika's gonna come back any moment and my mom's gonna lose her excuse.</p>

        <p>For a second, every single negative feeling I had about my mom just vanishes. But true to form, she finds a way to sabotage it immediately. </p>

        <p>"...Mu. Tonight. About that ritual. Tell me you won't participate in these stupid games anymore." </p>

        <p>Huh? Huh??? Did I hear her right? Is she finding a way to somehow blame me for this?</p>

        <p>"What?" I can barely believe it. So, I don't even respond properly.</p>

        <p>"Tell me you won't participate in these stupid games anymore," she says sternly.</p>

        <p>"What makes you think I WANTED this to happen?" I snap. Why does she always say things in the most absolute antagonistic way? I <em>know</em> this doesn't matter, but there's been so much negative emotion building in me I should be applauded for holding it in this much. "Why are you always, always like this?!"</p>

        <p>But she just keps at it. "Give me your word that you won't."</p>

        <p>"Of course I won't!"</p>

        <p>"Say it."</p>

        <p>"W-what?"</p>

        <p>"Say, 'I won't participate in these stupid games.'"</p>

        <p>"I alread-"</p>

        <p>"SAY it." Her voices hitches up for a sec, and I just gape and feel my eyes blinking really fast again.</p>

        <p>"I... won't participate in these stupid games."</p>

        <p>"Okay. Thank you."</p>

        <p>"...What's wrong with you?"</p>

        <p>I say it with disgust I immediately regret. I... couldn't help it. It's one of those times where tone of voice says everything, and I know I conveyed every ounce of contempt I had in my body right there.</p>

        <p>And my mom? Doesn't say a word back. She just lets the silence sit, and wordlessly, against the passenger seat window, slumps a bit and rests her head.</p>
