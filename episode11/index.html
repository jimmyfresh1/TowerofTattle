Prima 
//TTSAcquisition Shiori 2? Novelites. Playing with shadows.








Shiori feels anger in the air. Everything feels cold. 
Shiori plays with the town. the children themselves. 

ASP-intro-Magi literature at prima's house 
ASP-c-Alexa's room 
ASP-c-Shiori Shiori expresses preternaturalness as separate from supernatural
ASP-c-Mekuru You're telling me you went around chirping 'creatio ex nihilo' and 'reductio ad nihilum?!' I wanted to strangle my client


ASP-eMuto'sHouse-desc: A bunch of 90s stuff. Like Alex's Lake House. 

ASP-c-Alexa: "What were you thinking being there?"
-cont-Alphonse: "I'm sorry. I thought it was just... some kind of magic show." 
-cont-Mekuru: "Maybe if you'd been paying attention, you would've caught us."
-cont-Alexa: "Maybe you're right..." she muttered. 
-cont-Mekuru: I didn't expect that. And as we rode in the car back, everything silent, Shiori sleeping with her head rested against Alphonse, I realized it hurt more that she said that. 


ASP-intro-c-Muto 
ASP-intro-c-Prima "Say that you won't participate in this stupid game."

ASP-c-Mekuru-e5 Mekuru can't also help but be pulled into childishness. Now we're sitting there eating a big bowl of cereal. 



ASP-e5 They're going to drop off Shiori at Monika's place. It's dark and empty. She's probably off fooling around at the bar, Alexa tsked.
-cont-Alexa: We can wait here until she's back.
-cont-Shiori: Pl-lease... I don't...
-cont-Alexa: (gives in) I guess until the garden party... Monika'll be there, too. 
-cont-Shiori: (runs in to grab her things)
-cont-Alexa: Mekuru. I want you to tell me you won't be participating in these things anymore.
-cont-Mekuru: Are you kidding me? Of course, I won't.
-cont-Alexa: Say it.
-cont-Mekuru: Huh?
-cont-Alexa: Say 

ASP-c-Shiori: Comes back with a floppy disk. 
ASP-c-Mekuru: Where the heck are we gonna find a computer? I've only seen one in my life. It's in my mom's office and I don't really want to...




ASP-e5 And don't call me Lessie. don't act familiar with me. Alexa literally only does this with Muto and Prima. I've cleared out the bushes Lessie, the gardener said. Oh, thank you!
ASP-e5 Lessie's such a weird name, don't you think? It's like Lassie!

ASP-eSeance "Say you won't participate in this stupid game.' Alexa becomes actually quite vicious with Prima. This is confusing to everyone else who do not know why. For some reason Muto, her husban sits by and watches with his arms crossed. he does nto seem like the type of man to take that sort of thing lying down. he doens't respond though. later:"I'm a man who listens to his gut. Sometimes... you know... that you deserve something." 
-cont: Muto, what comeuppance could you possibly deserve and why?
