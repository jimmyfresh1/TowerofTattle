                "What were you thinking, Al? Did you not stop to think for two seconds?" 

                Looks like my mom won't be satisfied without dressing Al down even more. Though at this point, apologetic as he is, he seems a bit bored of it and like he's just nodding along. Actually, more than anything he looks tired. It's easy to forget he really is an old man. 

                "Sorry... thought it was a magic show," he mumbles, and the nodding along is starting to turn into nodding off.

                Meanwhile, Shiori's fallen completely asleep with her head on Al's shoulder. She actually sleeps pretty quietly, listening to her now. But every so often she lets out a small whimper, and I can't help but feel sorry. 

                "I just don't know what to do, Al," my mom mutters, though by now even she knows she's just talking to herself. "Can I even trust you with the kids anymore?"
                
                "Maybe if you'd been paying attention to us, you would've stopped us from going yourself," I say a bit icily. I can't help myself. 
                
                "Maybe you're right."

                She says it in such a straightforward tone. And after that, besides the sound of the car rolling over cobblestone, everything's silent. It actually hurts a little more that she just agreed with me. But I'm not bothered by it. 

                Muto, the sheriff, just keeps driving along silent as ever. Surprisingly, we're driving away from Rumueri Hill, but we're still driving into the woods. I must not have gone here much before, because I'm surprised that we start passing by trailer homes. I guess even Sussurokawa's got its "other half."

                My mom did say we "have to stop somewhere first" but I didn't expect it to be the sheriff's house. We pull into a gravel driveway, and the automatic light above the trailer's front door pops on just as we park. Unexpectedly, as Muto steps out of the car, so does my mom.

                "Just wait here a moment M... Mu," my mom says.

                "No. I want to come in." This is as good a place to start practicing my new strategy of proactiveness. My mom raises an eyebrow and pauses for a good long while, but... 

                "Suit yourself."
                
                Weird that she didn't even stop to ask Muto. I get that there's no way he'd say no, but isn't that a little rude?

                Honestly? Muto doesn't exactly look crazy about being home. Yeah, he looks stoic all the time, but now his steps have that extra 'trudge' to them. Maybe it'd be more accurate to say he doesn't <em>sound</em> crazy to be home, the way his feet drag ever so slightly against gravel.

                Muto unlocks the front door, and I almost sneeze from the smell of incense.

                I don't know what I expected from a sheriff's home, except that it would probably be at least tasteful, and, for the most part, that's true for Muto's place. It's clean and restrained. For the most part. 

                I can't help but notice lately that wood really does tell the tale. Most of the furniture looks like pine to me. A bit scratched up and used... maybe even secondhand. I'm not an expert, but I'm pretty sure the floor is pine, too. Normally you'd expect carpet or linoleum, or at least fake wood, but I step onto it and the way the sound rings out I just know. 

                There's oak too, just like my house, but it's reserved for a couple of important pieces of furniture. The first is a desk, probably Muto's, in the corner of the trailer right by the entrance to a small hallway -- which definitely leads to bedrooms. And the second is a huge bookshelf right across from where we came in.

                And that's the big sore thumb. The bookshelf takes about as much of the long wall as it can. And it's filled to the brim with occult crap. There's a whole shelf with nothing but crystals on it. A vaguely alchemical looking chalice with obtuse symbols lords over the top shelf, centered on an altar cloth which is hanging off a bit. Books with tarot trumps on the spine, or astrological signs, or evil malicious looking eyes all compete for shelf space.

                It's like all the eccentric got quarantined to one shelf. I get the vibe that this home is one bad day away from pentagrams finally taking over the whole place and just ruining the interior decorating. Plus, I hate to say it, it's pretty clear whose bad day would tip the trailer home's balance into complete occultism.

                She's sitting right at the dining table engrossed in a book right now. I guess from here I can't really see <em>what</em> she's reading, but the fixation on her face and creepy smile doesn't exactly scream med student to me. She hardly looks up at her husband and nods, pointing to some cold dinner sitting on the counter. 

                "Sorry. I would've made more if I knew people were coming."

                She doesn't even look at us. 

                "Prima."

                Surprisingly, it's not Muto who speaks to her first, but my mom. I can swear I see Muto's eyes narrow a bit, and he tactfully puts a hand on my back to direct me around to his desk, while he starts looking through it.

                "Yes, Lessie?"

                "Don't call me, Lessie. I don't like when you act too familiar with me."

                There's a lot of weird energy in the air right now, and it's not from the moon, quicksilver, or Satan. I hear Muto's tongue click -- for him, a dramatic expression of emotion -- and I suddenly remember that my mom does <em>not</em> usually care what people call her, because I know I've heard random workers around the house call her Lessie.

                "Lessie," the woman looks up slowly, and completely ignores the imperative. "How was the meeting of the Order of Light? Did you learn anything about magecraft today?"

                Huh? 

                "Prima," my mom says, a hand rising to her forehead and a vein throbbing in her temple. "This cult is getting dangerous. The town feels like it's going to be swept by it any day now. I need to crack down on it. Do you understand?"

                "Sure," Prima says amiably. "Why not?"

                Creepy.

                "That's why I can't have the wife of the town's sheriff participating as a member of that cult. I cannot have a divided front. None of us have the time to deal with you harassing us. Muto doesn't have the time to deal with you harassing us."

                "I'd say you're the one harassing me right now."
                
                "What I'm trying to say nicely, Prima, is that you can do all your occult bullshit as much as you'd like <em>after</em> we deal with this. I <em>need</em> a way to arrest the cult leader without the town rioting."

                Prima just shrugs.

                "Prima, do you not understand that you're putting your husband in danger? Do you realize we have four measily officers to protect a town of 1000 people?"

                Prima giggles scornfully. "Are you really calling it protecting us?"

                This is getting kinda bad. I tug at Muto's sleeve. "Um... I probably shouldn't be saying this. But are you just gonna stand by while my mom yells at your wife?"

                Muto just stays silent. He pulls out the desk's pencil drawer, feeling around for a while before finally grasping something. From what I can tell, he had something taped to the top of the drawer, and sure enough, he pulls out a key. Then he crouches down and with a bit of a groan reaches toward the back of the desk, again feeling for something. And yet again, he pulls out a key. 

                Meanwhile, my mom's voice is getting louder and louder, and Prima's voice is getting more derisive. Not gonna lie. I don't feel great about this.

                But Muto just again takes me tactfully and walks me over to the hallway.

Prima 













ASP-c-Shiori: Comes back with a floppy disk. 
ASP-c-Mekuru: Where the heck are we gonna find a computer? I've only seen one in my life. It's in my mom's office and I don't really want to...

ASP-e5 Lessie's such a weird name, don't you think? It's like Lassie!

ASP-eSeance "Say you won't participate in this stupid game.' Alexa becomes actually quite vicious with Prima.
