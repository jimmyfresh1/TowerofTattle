                </div>

                <div class="main">

                        <p>Just like everything else in this house, the study's all mahogany, all day.</p>

<p>                        Everything in this house is stiflingly wooden, but at least this room has a nice view. It must be facing the south given how much sun the room gets. Outside I can see that the patchy not-quite-fields of flowers and weeds surround the whole house. Beyond, though, are deep woods. The foreboding kind, without any real path into them, unlike the woods we've been walking through till now. </p>
                        
<p>                        Just at the edge of sight, though, one corner of those woods seems to be cleared out. In fact, there's a gate, suggesting something important lies past.</p>

<p>"What's past that gate over there?" I point it out to Shiori.</p>

<p>"Hm? I think there's an apple orchard there. Actually, your mom owns those, technically. I think she hates maintaining them, though, because everyone in town always talked about how they miss the local apples. Hannah doesn't maintain them, either."</p>

<p>"Doesn't seem like Hannah maintains <em>anything."</em></p>

<p>"Yeah that's just... how she always was," Shiori says, a hint of sadness coming through. But she doesn't waste any time moving The Codex around the room, listening for rustling.</p>

                        <p>Rows and rows of books, some of them absolute tomes. Though on the lowest shelves there's a
                                preponderance of children's books, the vast majority of them never even opened. Given
                                Hannah's antics... yeah. Don't need to be a wizard to figure out why those are there.
                        </p>

                        <p>"It was the right move coming here," Shiori says thoughtfully. It feels like the further away
                                from other people, the less she gets sucked into the role of her kid self. "Look. The Codex is
                                rustling like crazy. Even more than usual. Maybe there's more than one entry here?"</p>


                        <p>Looking around, the study's actually got a few curiosities on its shelves. Over to the far right shelf, rather than books, there's a bunch of stuffed animals. Something tells me though, that unlike the hopeful children's books, those stuffed animals are all actually hers. They look worn down.</p>

                        <p>On a few of the shelves though, there are standing photo frames. These aren't actually weird just by themselves, but... The Codex leads us to one of them. And it's a picture of a smiling kid. He's giving a thumbs up by the camera. It makes me shudder a bit to look at it, though I can't quite put my finger on why...</p>

                        <p>"Doesn't this look kind of like... a stock photo?" Shiori asks.</p>

                        <p>"Yeah, you're right! Jeeze, why would someone have that?" I shudder again. The photo itself isn't creepy. But having a framed stock photo is just... weird. Maybe it's just Hannah being <em>really weird</em> about kids again."Oh, hey."</p>

                        <p>As we're holding up the frame, the photo takes on that telltail snitch quality, that sudden bursting to life with way too much personality. It starts pecking at the inside of the frame as if to say, hey! Let me out of this prison! And we more or less oblige. Though I do make Shiori wait for a second until it starts pecking <em>nicely.</em></p>

                        <p>"It's not coming out until it says <em>please,</em>" I say.</p>

                        <p>"M..." Shiori starts. "You're kinda mean sometimes...</p>

                                        Creatio ex Nihilo. It all begins with this, but the beginning is most baffling of all. And yet I've been blessed with insight.

                                        <br><br>
                                        How many magi search after The Root or The Origin while imagining it as nothing more than a deterministic swirl? How could the seed that germinates into the universe be so simple, dull, and mechanical? Never. The hands of divinity have crafted this clock. Search for the clockmaker within the clock, and ye shall find proof. The gears are the witness. But shall ye find blood, flesh, or the hands that held the tools? 

                                        <br><br>
                                        From whence we came. To wither we are headed. Sophia appeared before my young eyes and tried to tell me, but I turned away in fear. The sublime overwhelmed me, and I have never felt it since. I have been blind. I have been deaf. My hands are numbed, and food is ashes in my mouth. The disgusting material world has the scent of a sewage. 

                                </div>

                                        All great things must endeavor to last beyond the ages. And the Netabare Nest will hold fast my legacy. I will outlive those who have criticized me. That much is sure. But my legacy shall out last nations.

                                        <br><br>
                                        The men and women who first journeyed with me to a desolate land have passed, and among them only the lovely Eris remains. 
                                        <br><br>
                                        But the seeds of those pioneers had sown now bear fruit. Once lifeless, the land now sustains. Who is it that said cast not to the rocky soil? I say, the rocky soil, unclaimed, shall bear the greatest fruits. The talents we bury in the ground shall be seeds for greater talents.
                                        <br><br>
                                        No one knows the the truth of what is nascent, what is latent, what is <em>budding</em> like Eris, who herself is an eternal bloom. Where my lowly self can only see what is, Eris can capture the scent of <em>what can be.</em>

                        <p>"Creatio ex nihilo..." Shiori mutters. Something seems to stir in her, and I think I can see her hands shaking a bit. It's like all the childishness from earlier got knocked right out of her. </p>

                        <p>I look her way. "Are you alright?"</p>

                        <p>"I'm fine. Just thinking." She says it a bit listlessly though. "I can't believe I'm seeing something supposedly written by Arcani Netabare." </p>

<p>                 The name stuck out to me, too. It seemed like Arekusa Netabare was already one horrible villain enough. Now we've got another Netabare with a ye olden name. "Who's Arcani?" I ask.</p>

<p>                        "He's the founder of the the entire lineage. The Netabares. Like I told you, when magi chase The Root, we're not talking about just one mad scientist alone once in a blue moon... It's a big, big, big project!" Shiori thrusts her arms out to show me just how big it is. "Entire families go after it for centuries. <em>Big families.</em>"</p>

<p>                        "He's the founder?" I pause a moment, confused. "But..."</p>

<p>                        "The Netabares are a young family."</p>

<p>                        "Oh. That makes sense."</p>

<p>                        "And by young, I mean that the first mention of them in the literature would've been from four centuries ago. If this is talking about the founding of the family, this 'document' would be at least four centuries old," Shiori says.</p>

<p>                        Now I'm tapping my foot trying to figure this out. Weirdly, though, The Codex despite taking in a new snitch, has <em>not</em> stopped rustling. Which means there probably is another snitch here. But the rustling makes it terribly hard to concentrate. "Okay, so what's this 'lineage of the face' stuff? You ever met one of these 'Kaobu Kakei' just running around the magi world with big ears or eyes?"</p>

<p>                        "No, I haven't..." Shiori stares fixatedly at The Codex. "Most magi lineages are discreet... but the Netabares are like, a family that built everything around the idea of secrets. No one really knows what they were up to. I don't even know who 'Eris' is supposed to be."</p>

<p>                        Shiori closes her eyes, rests her chin on one hand, and uses the other hand to tap her temple. She continues. "In fact, they disappear from magi society for decades at a time. Even when they're 'around', you can hardly catch sight of them. And if you do, they always, always wear masks."</p>

<p>                        "Wait," I say. "Is that including... Arekusa?"</p>

<p>                        Shiori opens her eyes and turns to me."Yeah it was a miracle that she ever taught at The Clocktower as a professor. It was the closest thing the family ever had to a public presence. I mean, she was before my time though... She'd already faded out of magi society by the time I was ever a proper mage." </p>

<p>                        "Huh. For some reason, I always got the sense that you'd met her before. Or at least seen her," I say.  </p>

<p>                        "I've just known a lot of people who knew her. She was a really big deal. A huge prodigy in the magi world. Anyone I've ever heard talk about her always said the same thing, though. She had a creepy <em>laughing mask.</em> That always matched badly with her apathetic voice," she says thoughtfully.  </p>

<p>                        "That <em>is</em> creepy."</p>



<p>"Isn't it kinda weird, though?" Shiori's at full concentration, the most 'magi' I've seen her since we got to The Heart. "The way Arcani talks about Sophia -- isn't it kinda simpy?" </p>
                        
<p>"It's what now?"</p>

<p>"Er, it's almost like he has a schoolboy <em>crush</em> on Sophia. It's already weird to anthropomorphize The Root like this. Not <em>unprecedented.</em> A big slice of the magi world is definitely Gnostic in its approach. So, The Root to them is more like an entity. And that entity is Sophia, the personification of wisdom, who's supposed to enlighten you and save you from the fake and horrific material world. But you're not literally supposed to go... um... goo goo gah gah for her." Shiori's eyes seem to lose concentration for a moment. Like she's pushing the limits of her ten year old brain. It doesn't help that the rustling's continued this whole time.</p>

<p>"People get up to all kinds of weird infatutions," I say. "If you've got this weird belief that everything you can touch sucks and is fake, and some beautiful lady is supposed to save you, then why wouldn't you fall in love with her?"</p>

<p>"So, you're saying Arcani sees himself as a fixer-upper?"</p>

<p>"I don't know what that phrase means, but somehow I know you're being tasteless." </p>

<p>We hit a lull in our thinking. And in the silence, the rustling a little unbearable. It reminds me of how I was when I was alone, constantly listening to the books swishing their secrets. Shiori's eye starts twitching.</p>

<p>"Let's find the next snitch," she says.</p>

<p>"...Yeah."</p>

<p>There's a desk stuffed into the top-right corner of the room, making me think that whoever does any work here likes to work in a cozy space. The rustling seems to get loudest near desk's pencil drawer. We pull the thin implement out, and among all the pens and stationary there's some filled-out order sheets for chemicals. For... diethyl ether.</p>

<p>"Ether?" Now I'm the one tilting my head.  "I don't even know what ether is used for."
</p>

<p>"I think I read a story once? They used the ether to ruin the guard dog's sense of smell," Shiori says to me.</p>

<p>At any rate, a few of the order sheets slowly twist themselves to life, and actually join <em>together</em> to become a single page. The text on the page scrambles around, letters reordering themselves into new positions. In fact, the characters literally twist upon themselves, letters becoming new letters.</p>

                Father has a lot of axioms. But mother pays the most attention to one. "Consumarre set Coniungi." To complete, is <em>to unite.</em> The exemplar of completion, of course, is consummation of marriage.

                <br><br>
                That much is not lost on me. I am the completion of both mother and father, and I'm proud of it. 

                <br><br>
                But it feels rather insidious to me, sometimes. I have a great nose like my mother. When I'm near people, like a scent, I can understand their potential, their <em>completed form.</em> Everything they could be. 
                <br><br>
                Or everything they could be a part of.

                </div>
                Sometimes I wonder how many go through the world completely unaware of the hint of mythic blood in them. I'm half dryad, so my lineage is apparent to me. But so many of our new citizens who come in, many of them are not even magi. 

                <br><br>
                They come less in search of Sophia, and more for a new start. We promise them things. Sometimes we offer them things. I'm afraid that, perhaps behind my back, my mother and father threaten them with things. 
                <br><br>
                But I'm too small of a person to protect every single person who comes here. If I can protect anyone, it would be the children. 
        </div>

</div>

<p>        Isn't this just a bit too coincidental?</p>

<p>        We know exactly one lady who's got a great sense of smell, and she also happens to love children. Also, 'Belladonna?' As in 'Beautiful Woman?' Wow. Just... wow. </p>

<p>
                "Isn't this just Hannah?" I ask. Might as well say the quiet part out loud.
        
</p>
<p>        Shiori starts biting her fingernail in response. I feel sort of sorry for being so blunt about it, because the implication seems to stress her out. "It makes some sense.... but not quite? I don't sense any actual mana from anyone around here. I mean, it's possible to suppress it, but something just doesn't feel right. For one thing, reading these two snitches one after the other, I feel like Belladonna must be Arcani's daughter. But Arcani must be long dead. So, at best, Hannah must be some kind of descendant. But besides that... Hannah has a terrible sense of smell."</p>

<p>
                "Huh? She was literally just <em>sniffing</em> us," I say.
        
</p>
<p>
                "Yeah, I know. I know! But that's just a thing she does! It's figurative! I know for a fact she's got an awful sense of smell. There was a time she was hospitalized because she mixed up some cleaning stuff wrong and couldn't smell it." Shiori's absolutely adamant.
        
</p>                        

<p>
                "That's right," a new voice pops in. "Nothing's as simple as it seems around here."

                Once again, Alexa's suddenly there, right between us.
