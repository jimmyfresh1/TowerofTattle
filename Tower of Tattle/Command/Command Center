//ADMONITION Here is where you strategize. I know I said having both a life planning strategy doc and a writing strategy doc sucked, and it kinda did, but a lot of it was just the Obsidian mixing, and having the overelaborate strategic tiers, when mostly I just think it makes sense to still have a running commentary  and strategy. Clearly efficiency has dropped since abandoning the run.
