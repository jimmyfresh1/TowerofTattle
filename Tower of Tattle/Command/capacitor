shiori also as a kid used to say lots of weird meta shit that creeped mekuru out
ok test testtesttesttesttesttest
remember mekuru has that kinda tweeny way of speaking 
maybe maybe a hint zoomer
reference the moon ending? at some point mekuru tries to run away from home and nearly dies in the cold?
but it's warmer than she remembers.
maybe they should actively note similarities to the story. 
oh. it's alexa who nearly died alone out there. yeah.

_
it"s mekuru herself who notes how shiori and her were just these loveless waifs

i really need to maek sure that i express shiori and mekuru having that initial tumult that matches these journal entries


needs to be in mekuru tw


who's like the worm? should i try to make someone like the worm?
monika?
alphonse?
some clocktower person?

there's a lot on top, 
but there's a light at the bottom,
the light at the bottom... 
it's an incinerator.
the disgusting sound of machinery harmonizing with subterranean water, as if the earth's heart was being shredded

i should put the rest symbol
and then i can say thre was a slight illusion
it's actually a fermata

their speech heavily reverts, so shiori's pretentions get alittle sillier, a lot sillier, whichis a convenient ywa of matching how she is now

there does need to be a downturn, sense of failure in arekusa's last notes

i  really do need to emphasize the development of girl x into an empty headed academic

ether reference, between hannah and ether 

"g-goodness,"shiori says, a twelve year old trying to talk like an aristocrat. umm... verily. 

line 63, elaboration, "amazing that i'd remember this before my own name", during moth story


umm... i suppose it's like... thinking because you've broken throughe arth's crust, you're anywhere near the core. it's a brilliant achievement, reaching the mantle. but ...

comparison between the mantle, the incinerator, the glow of magma. 

light consumes dark. 
a volcano?
ash fills the sky.


adjustment. talk about the root when they're at the lighthouse. 

#(elaboration: following the statement that prima pagetto came back:

Seems like she's trying to convince herself more than me. But I can't help but notice. 

"But how did you even know I was here? In Waechner's Vault?" I ask.

"D-don't you mean the Tower of Tattle?" she asks me. 

"...sure," I say, more than slightly aware that something about being back here seems to be affecting my apparent 'innocence.'

"I can't tell you that right now,")#

adjustment. probably talk about the root as they approach the lighthouse. that makes mroe sense. yeah.

test test test



"N...PCs?"

 "I guess you wouldn't know that term," she says sadly. "They'll be like robots with programming and behavior constraints."   elaboration taken out afte rshiori describes their behavior


musical motifs?
like dolente?
allegro?
risoluto?
