Nick you ugly bastard! Stop stringing her along!


"Mm. Not great. Al's got an eye for great art, but no heart to say she's no Picasso. Nick too cowardly to mention her complete lack of taste. Kyrie won't say it gives her the heeby jeebies." "And you?" "Don't like to hear cutting words. Won't say them." "Mom's honest, though." "Your mother is often mean. White noise." "No. It's a common misconception. He's not screaming himself. He hears it. Screaming." "...who? Who's... screaming?" "...nature. Nature's infinite scream." "Actually, based on the sky's strange color and the time of the pi" "Some hackfrauds think the scream is Krakatoa exploding. Silly. Needlessly impoverishes the piece. No imagination." Shiori falls silent and simply puffs up her cheeks while squeezing Yorick to her chest.


"...sorry. Said too much. Sometimes my tongue's still sharp." "Oh, Shiori always pouts." "No, you. Said too much about your mother." "I don't care. Say what you want about her." "No. You looked sad."



Clarie sings, and Mekuru and Shiori are transfixed.


Jeeze, look what my mom's wearing. Remember those stupid outfits she had us wear? "Uhh... Are we doing something useful right now?" "She's looking for us. I guess because we were originally at the party?"


They're spying from the veranda. The party is in the botanical garden. Those are toy binoculars. There was nothing else!


I can't believe you're actually making cider from that orchard. You've always been such a pain about it just because you hate apples! 


Mekuru we don't have time for this! We have to recover your 'self'! Everything else is just a sideshow! Shiori snapped. Or at least as much as Shiori could snap. "You're... You're right. I'm getting caught up."

Belladonna? Wow. Just wow.

For some reason, everyone has a really strong scent now...



We're closer to their core. Who they are. Sometimes you feel something more than your own name. 


Mekuru can't help herself and she turns her ears on more powerfully. Clarie kindly shuts her ears. 'It's ok. you don't have to.'


Shiori sees Hanari in breeches. "She's a horsegirl," Shiori whispered


Shiori makes inappropriate baby factory joke? Honestly, yes, probably at some point it's gotta happen

Hana has vague memories of her father leaving when she was young.	

Hana is a Judas lamb so she is also our best insight to how the children were like. Talks about children and their dreams and so forth. she keeps talking about children and children's dreams in a bit of a new agey way.
