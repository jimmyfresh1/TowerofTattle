nick spotted nearby where alphonse takes his life. //!!

This kind of thing is well documented actually. It's like different hands in mahjong. They all win, but some give you more points.//!!

There's something in the water! You're all drinking water bottles. I suppose you're gonna say that there's a huge conspiracy going on with Aquifina?//!!

shiori has a very public display of magic power, which makes everyone incredibly suspicious. it's after kyrie and clarie's death//!!

You're a disgusting person,' I'd said to my mom. I still remember how the words tasted coming off my mouth. //!!

Some people try to worship Shiori//!!

Say that you won't participate in this stupid game.//!!

i've seen her. (the woman in the fog) kiri. kira kiri. //!!

ah. i get it. it's the reasonable ones who are the most disgusting. when i thought of witch hunts, i thought of belligerent screaming people. but now i realize the worst ones act like they're concerned. everything sounds nice until you realize they think their mild manners justifies executing a young girl to save their skin. i hate their quietly demurring voices//!!

crazy cultist tries to kill shiori, and her powers flare up and hurt him//!!

you're telling me you went around chirping 'creatio ex nihilo' and 'reductio ad nihilum?!' I wanted to strangle my client//!!

are you telling me you woke up this morning and decided to wear a gorget? "are you telling me you didn't wear yours today?'//!!

somethihng appears blocking his knife. a little shield in his breast pocket with a werid little teddy bear. a loud clang is heard. ... reductio... ad... nihilum' someone muttered and creatio ex nihilo//!!

muto lies and declares that it was in hi spocket the whole time. //!!

Muto at one point has to stop someone who's physically threatening shiori. He sighs with relief. The tension all leaves his body. Sits down, puts his hand to his forehead. You wanna know something shiori, he says with a derisive smile. The gun's fake. //!!

at some point people gather around shiori trying to worship her//!!


//scenebits Nick, having a pretty good read on people: "Was she really doing her best for me? Can't say I think so. Still, I always got the sense I was one of the few people she could stand. Your mom's got her reasons. "To have you killed?" Nick gave a long a hard look like he'd eaten something sour. "This town's... different Mekuru. I don't expect you to get it. A kid shouldn't have to."
