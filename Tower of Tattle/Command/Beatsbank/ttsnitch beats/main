Those children... shouldn't we just end their suffering? //!!

Shiori tastes the poisoned meal.to spit it out . alexa snatches it out fo her hands//!!

I can't stop myself from chuckling but shiori actually looks sad.//!!

"Heiress. It's the kiddy insults that hurt people the most. By the way you smell terrible. Must be because you're noveau riche trash."//!!

People get lost in the forest. Can't leave without permission //!!

It's just... A dumb story. If a precocious dumb girl who soaked up her wrath like a sponge and didn't know where to splash it//!!

They .. deserved... Everything. So did I. And what happened? did it make nayone happy?Mom getting lectured. //!!

There were... So many... Happy endings that could have been. //!!

It's... Basically scathing exegetical satire. It's almost... Puerile.//!!

Is... This what I look like to shiori...? I'm afraid to even ask.//!!

people accuse nick of doing dastardly things with it//!!

it's dasani! blame the coke company! pepsi company joke//!!

Even then you'd go through life not even remembering who you are... Haven't you noticed... Your reflection?//!!

sand filtered water. it tastes great. people like it. after,when the filter breaks donw, peopel have to drink the tap that nick brings in. //!!

a strange sullen break in the storm.//!!

all the heirs had a viable path, except for nick, who wasn't truly related to his mother, a great irony//!!

Hm? This fresnel lens is weird. it's like it's producing... a second beam downward? //!!

The lighthouse has always been like that he shrugged. Well. Not like tons of sailors were ever passing through here//!!

This is the first memory mekuru gets back fully. It feels good. It makes her happy. Oh I should have this after mekuru says she doesn't need her name.
Shiori talks about the lighthouse of Alexandria. You know, Alexandria means defender. They protected knowledge. //!!

At the harbor. What's the secret ingredient for the brownies. They're so good.
The demiurge...? No... He's a fool figure. He thinks he's god. That's the story. He created the material world because he believed himself the pinnacle of creation. And with it he created suffering //!!

They're Pillsbury he chuckled.//!!

"Locked" snitches. That they only figure out during the trial. Particularly the kurakiri one //!!

Alexa has a moment of chagrin. Isn't it ironic? Lessias supposed to mean defender.//!!

The sins of the village fell squarely on its weakest kid //!!

Right here. At the very bottom It's right belowThe light Every floor does the same skylight thing//!!

there are natural springs around here. that said, we did put filters, yes.//!!

Talking about Kyrie and clarie. Well they...became who... They each admired...//!!

at this point, in kyrie's mind, whoever was doing these kidnappings was fine murdering. if she really left and then killed, she couldn't stand it. she was certain whatever monika tried, she should be able to fend her off. //!!

actually kyrie probably directly meets alexa, and probably monika is already dead//!!

Mekuru and shiori we're changing hands a lot. It really made them into love starved waifs//!!

froze to death. burned to death. and then ears blown out. all at once.//!!

it's actually one long crazy night when kyrei, clarie, monika die.//!!

What a cruel joke.//!!

Monika herself leaves the note that she's gone somewhere else//!!

"what ... happened to the other scuba suit?' //!!

sounds to me like in her distress she could only think about her hobby could you blame her?"//!!

alexa constantly trying to send mekuru away. makes her seem super unloving. even says i don't care about you mekuru. go. //!!

good. with this, even though it's alexa doing a "good" thing, it comes off extremely negatively. which is great for managing reader perception of her//!!

alexa did not want mekuru to see her in the trial. "this is disgusting mother. "alexa flinched. //!!

nick originally sees her off. maybe with some nice boarding school lady. she pretends to get in the car. yadda yadda. something. oh. she pretended to have a stomach ulcer or something. //!!

Monika immolates herself performing the silly sulfur trick, so her body is discovered right by when screaming is heard//!!

alexa acting as prosecutor? a very small percentage majority votes for nick's guilt//!!

alexa tries to send mekuru off twice. first to boarding school or something. then later on with the doctor. mekuru returns both times.//!!

framing nick through insurance money.. classic. i was named the beneficiary?by the old man?//!!

perhaps nick can truthfully and perpetually testify that he saw her. a misty woman.  so it would sound like he was trying to pin everything on the boogieman. he tried to chase her but she disappeared.//!!

into sunlight? the jury asked doubtfully. that's right nick said.//!!

kyrie and clarie's father was a coal magnate, or so the story goes, who controlled labor in the town. he built most of the town proper too//!!

Nick is always talking about dishes and flavor profiles. Bitter like poison huh? Nick is always thoughtful.Accidentally switched sandwiches with shiori. Oh... That has horse radish.//!!

the children in the past could actulaly have simply gone through the coal mines maybe//!!

there are waterlogged parts of the connection between underneath the lighthouse //!!

Mekuru barely... Barely hears Shiori's voice across the void. Shiori feels her presence. //!!

  And Hana imitating Arcani with painting, while alphonse listens attentively as hannah talks about flowers//!!

Also clarie not being good at piano but it's not some awful thing. Just clumsy. //!!

..is... Is Kyrie a good writer. Clarie keeps her mouth shut.//!!

They run into the first tell tail snitch near arcani's place. It's the netabare apocryphon but it has no nest. Maybe. No. Would it be fine if it's girl X's?//!!

Well the doctor got in fine didn't she?//!!

Muto is an actual detective. Works with Kyrie and even clarie //!!

Shiori realizes it but keeps quietly eating while tearing up terribly. Mekuru sighs then takes a bite then nearly throws up.//!!

when the town floods, the people seem to fade into dust. they mix with the insipid water. but it's still water. mekuru is still about to drown.//!!

alexa actually is a really good swimmer. alexa brings her to the top of the light house. //!!

muto is the one who defends mekuru until the very end. //!!

i guess waechner stopped by and picked up prima and sort of "dissolved" the lighthouse//!!

i can make it a scene. alexa looking at prima with disgust resentment pain and fear. //!!

oh. i get it. even my mother shivers around her mother. //!!

final moment alexa and clarie just talk. wine in front of me. i'll tell you what clarie. we'll both drink one. how about one last game?//!!

nicer than usual, huh?//!!

the disappearance into the earth, like the pied piper//!!

 they walk around and come back on the place tghey came. oh i found the exit! no that's where we came from... oh... ah. there's like...a hearth... here. in themiddle...um... let's light it. this recalls the earlier scene in part vi where they had trouble lighting a fire. this wood must be ancient...bring the pillow out! but...but... it's all we've got ... shiori groans. once again an acrid nad chemical smell fills the air. //!!

alphonse likes crossword puzzles. he chuckled. you think sailors are dumb? i've been all over the world. when? shiori asked. hell if i remember. i'll tell you this. we've got just about the worst sand in the world. oh? where's the best sand in the world? the florida panhandle.//!!

with.. the exception of dangerous ones of course,' hannah frowns. someone planted some giants hogstail here. now we're dealing with it still. oh you actually do work sometimes, huh?//!!

they shift unsteadily while waiting for the fire to catch. the picture comes into view. ah... it's a weird hearth... almost like... a cupid's bow. a gag of flame and a collar of ash. it's alreaady decapitated. they actively notice this. worm like potrusion in ... you know where. four arms hold the sphere up like pillars on the next level. then three legs. oh... oh... ? it's the aristophanes human. well they're spheres with four arms and four legs. it was meant to be a joke. i don't get it. me neither. well, where's the fourth leg? then they see the giant snake worm penis
