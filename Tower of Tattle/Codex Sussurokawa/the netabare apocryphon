**The Netabare Apocryphon**
I. "Creatio ex Nihilo. It all begins with this, but the beginning is most baffling of all. And yet I've been blessed with insight.

How many magi search after The Root or The Origin while imagining it as nothing more than a deterministic swirl? How could the seed that germinates into the universe be so simple, dull, and mechanical? Never. The hands of divinity have crafted this clock. Search for the clockmaker within the clock, and ye shall find proof. The gears are the witness. But shall ye find blood, flesh, or the hands that held the tools? 

From whence we came. To wither we are headed. Sophia appeared before my young eyes and tried to tell me, but I turned away in fear. The sublime overwhelmed me, and I have never felt it since. I have been blind. I have been deaf. My hands are numbed, and food is ashes in my mouth. The disgusting material world has the scent of a sewer. 

I am older and wiser; will she not see me again? Perhaps not, but the Netabare lineage will endeavor. (Sincerity can only arrive from openess)"

vestigium legere

In the context of your story, "vestigium legere" could indeed symbolize a more dynamic, perhaps even a bit hasty or urgent, approach to understanding or discovering knowledge. It's like a character who isn't content with just passively receiving information from a structured source like a codex, but rather is actively searching, piecing together clues, and trying to read between the lines. This method might be less methodical than following the 'spine' of a book (as with "codex"), but it could be more intuitive or holistic, capturing a sense of eagerness or desperation to uncover truth.

the observer

Now, regarding "vestigium legere," which means "to read the traces" in Latin, this is also a fascinating concept. It suggests a process of reading or interpreting the signs, clues, or remnants of something. It's akin to piecing together a story or understanding from fragments left behind, whether they're physical traces, historical records, or metaphysical signs.

so, it's a bit too elaborate to explain in full detail, but essentially one of the characters, arekusa netabare, tries to form a path to the root by retracing literal biological conception. going by the ancient view of the microcosm reflecting the macrocosm, she believes very literally that ontogeny recapitulates cosmogeny. this is because the moment that person is conceived, a soul must enter their body from somehwere. hence, it is creatio ex nihilo, albeit in a small form. she sees this as a possible path to The Origin, otherwise known as The Root. I want to emphasize this route as the path through the codex, the codex being the double helix of DNA. similar to how a book spine holds a book together, the double helix is a structure that allow sfor a generative codex. there's quite a lot of literary allusion here, as the word codex literally means tree trunk in latin. hence, it is tracing to the roots through the trunk itself. 


Now, here' sthe thing. i want to contrast this with a second route which is important in the story. this is the path presented by shiori novella. i don't know how much of shiori nvoella's lore you know, but she explicitly has seen secret knoweldge through a bookmark. in her opening lore video she mentions seeing the beginning and end of universes. i want to make this known to the reader as the index route, whcih contrasts with the codex route. shiori's hair is parted in the middle, white on one side, black on the other. i would liek her lroe to be that she observed the moment of the end of one universe nad the creation of the next... but it's left ambiguous whether it was the end of this universe or its beginning, or if it's even cyclical. similar to reaching truth in full metal alchemist, this gives her a certain understanding of the worl dthat changes her indelibly. essenitally, shiori is allowed to peek at any moment in time. however, in a certain sense, if she peeks and 'spoils herself', it fixes the moment and makes it deterministic. this humorously matches the netabare name which means spoielrs. anyway, i have index contrasted with codex, but i need a ccontraast with ontogenetic.

ontogeny recapitulates cosmogeny


a part of alexa's theorizing that talks about different types  ontegenetic relations: twins, father and child, mother and child. but the most powerful of all these would be mother and daughter. 


Arekusa 1 which is Family Chronicle 5 calls foolish. Secrets are not found high in the sky. They are found in the depths, below. One must journey into the World of Dark to find ultimate light. Adam wriggled like a worm on the ground. Where else shall we find him?

talk about different candidates for the 'path.' it could've been clarie and kyrie, as twins.  hana and arcani could also have been candidates. chirality. elft hand right hand.  we can make a list of characteristics needed. chirality is needed for the spiral upward. 


Haha is a pun, for haha as in mother. Alexa makes this pun
