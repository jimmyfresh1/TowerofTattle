**Musings of a Certain Heiress**

The reason Hana kills her mother is because kurakiri got in her head. Yes! Perfect.full circle. She got it in hanas head that her mother was going to kill her . This is what leads to so much of claries self loathing. It wasnt entirely unjustified. She hated eris who was also a shitty person. Maybe she thought things would just somehow get better

heiress journal entry: i'm exhausted. i just have to thank god she didnt become enamored with some bigger animal like a dog or whale.
