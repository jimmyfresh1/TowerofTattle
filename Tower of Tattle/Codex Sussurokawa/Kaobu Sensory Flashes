Kaobu Sensory Flashes

final moment alexa and clarie just talk. wine in front of me. i'll tell you what clarie. we'll both drink one. how about one last game?


How did eris taste lol: like bamboo shoots with blood, earthy, nutty, like  a forest after rain, with sudden tastes of iron. 

"it's fine," her mother said. "i've made everything fine."

i suddenly feel very sick, knowing what that vision was. (hana eating eris)

clarie: hey... sing me a song. alexa: are you really going to ask that of me? clarie: please

this leads her into despondence. the feeling of having destroyed everything for nothing at all. that despondence is what led her to use mekuru instead. oh i guess... the fact that prima was there. xa
