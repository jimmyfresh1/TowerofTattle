                                        Adam smells the scent of life, and she deepens his breath.

                                        Adam tries to speak, and she unties his tongue.

                <p><em>Rustle, rustle.</em></p>

                <p>However the tome makes me feel, though, ends up being a secondary point. Because, to the surprise of me and Shiori, The Codex starts rustling. How the heck are we gonna get a stone tablet in there? And won't everyone be mad that it's missing?</p>

<p>                That's when <em>two</em> snitches fly out of The Codex. Rather than fly straight to the tablet, they actually start ripping a page out of The Codex, the page wriggling in dismay as it's torn out. That <em>loud</em> ripping sound makes me wince. The whole sequence looks like something out of a cruel nature documentary. </p>

<p>                It doesn't end with the ripping either. Now the two dextrous snitches are taking the paper, still wriggling, onto the tome and sort of trying to peck the imprint of the carved edifice into it. Soon enough, the ripped paper starts taking on a new shape, and I could swear the paper itself was changing into something thicker. By the time they're done pecking a new identity into it, the new snitch looks something like a hawk. </p>

<p>                And it snatches its two tormentors and violently whisks them back into The Codex. Which, honestly, those two bullies had it coming. </p>

                <p>"Why couldn't they just all be friends?" Shiori asks sadly.</p>

                                        <h3>The Netabare Apocryphon II</h3>
                                        <small>1</small>
                                </div>

                                From whence we came. To wither we are headed. The duality of creation and destruction, is the balance of light and dark. A flash of light created this universe. But what came before?
                                <br><br>
                                Order was wrestled out of Chaos, and Leviathan was mastered and dominated in the deep, dark. Thus, a paradox, terrifying to those unwilling to achieve Gnossis: the dark came before the light. Is it not in the name? Creatio ex nihilo. Something from nothing, because nothing came before. Creatio ex nihilo, <em>ergo creatio post nihilo.</em>

                                <br><br>
                                And thus, the question must be asked. From whence we came? From darkness. To wither we are headed? If we are fools, then we shall inexorably trek toward darkness once more. 
                        </div>
                </div>

                <p>The Netabare family again? Just how central are they to the mysteries of Sussurokawa? </p>

                <p>Shiori and I mull it over as we go to find Al, who went ahead to 'grab some seats and rest his old knees.' Shiori is absolutely lost in thought. I can't help but think that her inner magus is turning the gears and connecting the dots.</p>

                <p>"From whence we came, to wither we are headed..." Shiori repeats. "Isn't that... Isn't that like Cotton Eyed Joe?"</p>

                <p>"...What? Are you serious? I was just fawning over you," I say.</p>

                <p>"No, seriously! It's just like the lyrics! 'Where did you come from, where did you go?'" Shiori starts.</p>

                <p>"'...Where did you come from, Cotton Eyed Joe?'" I finish. "Boy. If Arcani could hear you now, he'd probably smack you."</p>

                <p>"He wouldn't! It's a modern version of his writing!" </p>

                <p>Suddenly, the hairs stand on the back of my neck. Not from Cotton Eyed Joe, but from the feeling that people are talking about us. I can <em>hear</em> their whispering. No... they're not talking about us.</p>

                <p>They're talking about Shiori.</p>

                <p>...heard her talking to herself... </p>

                <p>...I saw it! Those shadows gathered around her...</p>

                <p>For her part, Shiori doesn't seem to notice. In fact, she just keeps humming away the chorus of Cotton Eyed Joe over and over. Thank god she can't hear them. But then again... that's trouble in its own way.</p>

                <p>And speak of the devil, a shady looking young guy comes up to us. Unkempt, long hair, sweats. I don't wanna judge a book by its cover, but...</p>

                <p>"You have some business with us, son?" Al asks, voice still friendly, with just a hint of caution and warning. Looks like he's got some awareness of what's in the air too. "You're making these two young ladies nervous."</p>

                <p>Then he does just about the worst thing he could.</p>

                <p>He actually goes and wordlessly <em>genuflects</em> to Shiori, and she turns her head every which way confused, before she realizes he's really kneeling to her. She starts absolutely shaking, and Yorick gets really riled up. He's almost trying to jump out of her hands to get at the guy.</p>

                <p>But that's the creepiest part. It's almost like the guy's... looking right at Yorick.</p>

                <p>Before long, though, a nicely dressed lady comes and grabs him by the scruff of his hoodie. The difference between them, appearance-wise, is enormous. She's in a lilac, knee length dress, the kind you could wear to both a PTO meeting or a gala. He's... looking like he could be homeless, honestly.</p>

                <p>"Goodness, we're so sorry about that," the lady says with the most saccharine tone I've ever heard.</p>

                <p>"R-right... v-verily. It's okay. G-graces." Shiori stutters out. I guess she's trying to calm herself by acting like her adult self?</p>

                <p>"Go," Al growls. And the lady needs no further prompting. With a dainty wave, and a plastered on smile she pulls her companion along and away.</p>

                <p>"Here, Shiori," I say as soothingly as possible. "I picked up a program for the... it's a seance, actually. You were excited for it, right?"</p>

                <p>"Y-yeah!" We open up to the first page, and she actually gives a small squeal of delight. "Oh! Oh oh oh! I remember! This seance... I was interested because they were gonna talk about the twilight maiden!"</p>

                <p>Who?</p>

                <u><strong>Kurakira(暗キラ), the twilight maiden. </strong></u>
                <p><em>Today we establish the fact. She is no myth. She is real. And she is watching.</em></p>

                <p>"The local boogieman," Al says with a strangely somber voice and sighs. "Can't say it's a legend I like to hear. But I suppose it's all harmless fun."</p>

                <p>"Why's Al sighing?" I ask Shiori.</p>

                <p>"Because so many people in town believe "Kurakira" stole the children away. You know, all those kids some people believe existed. Kurakira... The name means like, 'dark light?' Or 'sparkle in the dark.' Kurakira can only be seen at the exact moment of twilight, when the last flicker of sun gets in your eyes. That's why she's the twilight maiden. So a lot of people think, during one moment of twilight, she took all the children like the Pied Piper!" Shiori says breathlessly. "Oh! Oh! But there's a creepy part!</p>

                <p>Was kidnapping children into the twilight not the creepy part?</p>

                <p>"No matter who you are... they say that she 'persuades' people to join her into the twilight. But! But! Unlike the kids! Who go into a mountain or something! The others..." Shiori makes a little cutting motion at her neck. "So she gets blamed for... you know! Around here!"</p>

                <p>Al sighs and still looks a bit bothered by it all. But he just pats Shiori's head comfortingly, I think to make sure she knows he's not bothered by <em>her.</em> </p>

                <p>As Shiori starts rambling about an entirely different set of cryptids, I notice that the program's been rustling all the while. I guess it shouldn't be surprising that this one's a snitch. This time it actually turns itself into a little bat, and when it goes into The Codex it hangs itself upside down from the top edge and squeezes in as the book shuts.</p>

                                        <h3>Musings from a Certain Heiress</h3>
                                        <small>1</small>
                                </div>

                                It's hard being better than everyone else. Everything becomes a series of tedious and predictable events. Some of the have-nots had the nerve to try and talk to me. But I did my duty of noblesse oblige, and simply ignored them as is proper. As father tells us. 
                                <br><br>
                                The hardest part is that with primacy comes responsibility. The Netabare name is not a small burden. And who else is up to the task? My sister? She's hardly even a person. It's absurd. How can someone possess the gift of Keijō Soku 経常触 and then be a dumb, emotionless robot? Yes, it is awful to point out, but she is dumb.

                                <br><br>
                                I'm just gonna say it. I think my sister is retarded. I mean that purely in the medical sense. 
                        </div>
                </div>

                <p>Wow, I <em>really</em> hate this girl.</p>

                <p>My ears perk up. It's a subtle thing, the way the chatter changes. It gets louder for a minute, as if people are subconsciously aware something's about to happen. And all of a sudden, a hush, consensus of the crowd. The lights go out.</p>

                <p>Looks like the seance is beginning. </p>

                <hr>
                <hr>

        <p>And of course, just like any respectable seance <em>should</em>, it begins with a man in some quasi-religious robe wheeling out a cabinet on tall rolling legs. You know. So you <em>know</em> there's no trap door. Al was right. This really is just a dumb magic show. </p>

        <p>Slowly, slowly he opens it, with as much drama as possible. Even with a sliver you can see 'there's nothing inside', but even so he makes us wait through an agonizing half-minute of shocking non-reveal.</p>

        <p>Then boom! He slams it shut. And boom! He throws it open so violently the cabinet's hinges squeal. Amazing. Shocker. There she is! A masked woman appears in the cabinet from seemingly thin air!</p>

        <p>Looks like she does this <em>every single time</em> because the whole town hall can barely come together to muster a polite clap. Erm. Except for Shiori, actually, who's clapping so excitedly you'd never know that she's the one who can actually use magic. </p>
<p>
                        "Welcome! Welcome! Children of the Order of Light!"
        
</p>
<p>                In the dark room, the spotlight turns on and centers itself right on the stage. A masked figure walks onto the stage. Just... walks. Not that I was interested in the 'performance,' but there's something completely anticlimactic about the fact that this masked woman is just your regular old huckster. </p>

                        <p>The whole town hall claps politely, while Shiori gets on her tip toes clapping with excitement she can't contain.</p>
                        <p>"You there!" the masked woman points to a heavyset man in the back. "You ate a meal this morning... no, perhaps noonish. It was tasty, but also mediocre!"</p>

                        <p>"I did have a tasty but mediocre meal around 10AM," the man says awed. </p>

                        <p>"And you!" She points to a younger woman. "You feel that you deserve more from life... but you also appreciate what you have!"</p>

                        <p>"My husband's a putz!"</p>

                        <p>"Well, I hope he's not in attendance," the masked woman says, to polite chuckles. "Now let us begin. Children of the Order of Light. I greet thee on the doorstep."</p>
<p>
                        "<em>We are glad to arrive.</em>"
        
</p>

        <p>Hm? Something feels a bit off here. The staid call and response echoes through the town hall.</p>

                        <p>"I welcome you into my home."</p>

                        <p>"<em>We are honored to be guests.</em>"</p>

<p>I start to feel very nervous about us being the only ones in the room who don't know the proper responses. Is everyone else watching us? Just how much are we standing out?</p>

                        <p>"I nourish you as if you were my own child."</p>

                        <p>"<em>We were famished, but now we are full. We were motherless, but now we are cared for.</em>" </p>


                <p>A chill runs down my spine. The call and response doesn't sound much different from what you'd hear in a church. Have these meetings been going on a long time? The entire room keeps answering  in unison, in a tone so practiced it almost sounded bored. There's a different kind of reverence that comes with something becoming so internalized it's routine. </p>

<p>
                        "Do you step out of the dark?" the masked woman asks.
        
</p>
<p>
                        "<em>We step into light.</em>"
        
</p>
                <p>I'm not really sure how much of this subtext Shiori is catching. She looks a little bored and uncomfortable, and she's just looking around rocking back and forth on her heels. Meanwhile, I can see Al is gripping his legs pretty hard.</p>

                <p>There's something subtly terrifying about it. The way the masked woman minces around like an obvious fraud, and the people respond to it like it's the most mundane thing in the world. It's like... believing your toothbrush is gonna be there tomorrow morning. </p>

                <p>"Excellent, excellent," the woman calls out theatrically. "Please, everyone. Greet our new friends. This is their first time coming."</p>

                <p>"<em>We welcome you into our house.</em>"</p>

                <p>"Obliged," Al says gruffly.</p>
                <p>"T-thank you?" Shiori says.</p>

                <p>I just stay silent and shift uncomfortably.</p>

                <p>"On this wonderful day," the masked woman says. "We are honored to have the vicereine's daughter, and her friend Shiori. Shiori, we do hope you feel welcome. It is a shame that in this town, the store doesn't stock your favorite cereal. Trix, was it?"</p>

                <p>"H-huh? Yeah! Yeah that's my favorite cereal!" Shiori still looks scared, but her eyes are shining a bit. She's completely pulled into her past self right now.</p>

                <p>"We want nothing more than for you to feel like you belong. You do not need to feel so alone that you'd play by yourself at the creek whenever the vicereine's daughter is not there. It is not wise to be a child alone in this world. You never know who is watching. You never know who sees what deeds or miracles you may do."</p>

                <p>Shiori's eyes go wide. This is getting out of hand. But I don't know what to do.</p>

                <p>"I don't think I want to be here... anymore..." Shiori says quiet as a mouse. </p>

                <p>The whole congregation just looks at us silently, and it's suffocating. Shiori tugs at Al's sleeve, and he pulls us both into his sides protectively. </p>

                <p>"Let's go, then," Al says as calmly as he can. He grabs the both of us and scans the room. But he never had a chance. Almost immediately, we're roughly pulled away from him and brought to the masked woman, while Al yells obscenities at the men holding him back. </p>

<p>                "Fear nothing, for I am only here to speak the truth that will soon be," the masked woman says. All Shiori and I can do is stare silently at the ground in response, while Yorick thrashes around violently in her hands like he wants to square up and fight. Then, incredibly, the masked woman just outright grabs one of Shiori's hands and violently tugs her. I try to do <em>something</em>, but a strong grip keeps me in place.</p>

<p>Yorick actually falls to the ground in the struggle and I think the fall actually knocks him out.</p>

<p>Yorick...</p>

<p>And without him there, Shiori's mental state clearly starts deteriorating way past panic. If she was shaking before, it's worse now. And I can hear her breaths get quicker and shallower.</p>

<p>
                        "The future of Sussurokawa lies within this wonderful, giving hand. Do you know Shiori? You've been gifted with Keijo Soku. You who can feel the tremors of others' hearts, have been tasked with rebuilding this broken town."
        
</p>
                <p>Huh? Keijo Soku? Didn't I just read that in The Codex?</p>

                <p>"The fault lies with... you." The masked woman points toward Al, who snorts in response. "You and the others on Rumeuri Hill who have misused thine gifts. Those who have dared to ask for more, who have begged for more light than their neighbor, shall be denied it. Just as she dragged the children of this town into the light, you shall be dragged into darkness. One by one, Kurakira will take back Sophia's gifts."</p>

                <p>"I've seen her! Kurakira! I've seen her at the moment of twilight!" a congregation member yells. </p>

                <p>Whispers move throughout the congregation, and the masked women simply lets them percolate through the crowd and hang in the air. </p>

                <p>"Look here!" the masked woman says, framing Shiori's face with her hands. "The proof is in her hair, split perfectly between light and dark! The proof is in the gold of her eyes, the perfect shine at that moment of twilight!"</p>

                <p>The whispers raise to a fever pitch.</p>

                <p><em>...on the banks of creeks... playing with the shadows...</em></p>

                <p><em>...she DOES have weird hair...</em></p>

                <p>The masked woman raises Shiori's hand in the air.</p>

                <p>"For this girl has a more wonderful gift than you on Rumeuri could imagine. Soon, by her very hand, she shall intercede. And you, of the eye, will be forced to see only darkness as you are returned to the twilight!" The masked woman continues to berate Al, who laughs loudly and sardonically in response. </p>

                <p>"And you... the vicereine's daughter. You hear what others do not, yes? The gift of Keijō Chō" (経常聴)." I feel myself freezing up and trembling as the masked woman raises her hand to my face.</p>

                <p>"Don't touch her. Don't you dare." </p>

                <p>...Mom?</p>

                <p>The masked woman who had no problem antagonizing us earlier freezes at the sound of my mom's voice. </p>

                <p>Suddenly, a loud siren can be heard outside. A single officer walks in, but it seems it seems to be enough to part the crowd of the congregation. Oddly, close behind him is a woman in a sunny dress.</p>

                <p>"This gathering is over," my mom says flatly.</p>

                <p>"Tyrant!"</p>

                <p>"Soccer mom!"</p>

                <p>A few boos ring out from the audience, but not much else. My mom comes marching over and snatches me away from the masked woman, who just backs off silently. I'm definitely not blinking back tears or anything. But it was a little scary.</p>

                <p>"Thank god you guys came," Al sighs. The tension leaves his body all at once and he looks exhausted.</p>

                <p>"What were you thinking, Al?! How could you bring these two here?" my mom asks in a rage.</p>

                <p>Al looks absolutely flustered. "Now Lessia, I don't think it's fair to blame me. This event was being held in our very own town hall. How could I know it'd turn out like this?"</p>

                <p>"Sure, Al. You've convinced me," my mom spits out. "Why not give the kids those excuses?"</p>

                <p>Al groans, knowing she's right, and just brings himself eye level to me and Shiori. "I've really gone and done it, huh?"</p>

                <p>Shiori just shakes her head. "It's okay... it wasn't your fault. I wanted to go."</p>

                <p>To be honest, I do think it was kind of his fault and I'm a little mad still. And I turn my face away because I don't want him to see that I am actually still blinking back tears. "I forgive you," I say quietly. It's gonna take a little time though.</p>

                <p>"Muto, keep the soothsayer aside for questioning. She can think it over in a jailcell tonight. Maybe longer."</p>

                <p>The masked woman seems frantic and surprised, somehow. "Seriously?"</p>

                <p>I can't help but feel resentful. It feels like she's getting off light. But I don't know how Sussurokawa does things exactly. I'm sure Shiori feels the same way, though maybe more than anything she's just trying to move on from it. </p>

                <p>Still, trembling as we are, when the masked lady walks past us, we do the only thing we can as kids and make faces at her. </p>
