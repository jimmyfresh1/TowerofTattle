                        The actual town of Sussurokawa Cove is about as beautiful as it gets. Right through the center of town is a grand cascade. It's nature aided along by some artifice, a natural waterfall enhanced with a stony path ready made to cut through the town center and go straight out to sea. A large cobblestone bridge connects the two halves of town, but it's the town hall built into the bottom of Rumeuri Hill that <em>really</em> seems to keep the town stuck together. 

                        If you looked at the town from the front, the grand cascade would look like a series of steps leading up to the town hall. The water flows underneath it.
