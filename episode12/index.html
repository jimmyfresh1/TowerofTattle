<p>                Shiori's been all smiles and all humming ever since she got her stuff from Monika's house. Where's Yorick? He's in a big 'ole paper bag -- the kind you'd get from a department store -- and rolling around her clothes toothbrush happily, taking in her mood. </p>

<p>                Cotton Eyed Joe. That's right. The only sounds in the car are the wheels on road, Al's snoring, and Shiori humming Cotton Eyed Joe. There's almost more silence in the car than there is sound. There's the strained silence between me and my mother. There's Muto being...mute-o. And there's the general air of tired silence that permeates a long day. The only reason Shiori's an exception is because she just recovered from a fitful bout of her own silence. </p>

<p>
                    I guess we're taking shifts.
    
</p>
<p>                From there to my bed is a blur with just a few highlights of wakefulness for me. I think I remember Al making old man sputtering noises when we woke him up to drop him off at The Creepy Peach. Seeing him lean against Hannah as he tiredly walked and waved goodbye was a sweet moment in an otherwise awful night. I don't <em>remember</em> drifting off... But before I know it, I wake up in a fright, Shiori slumbering away right next to me as we share my bed.</p>

<p>                It's strange how people work. For a moment, I'm in a reverie, dreaming my first dream. I dream about a time I spent a week away from home because my mom made me some outdoorsy summer camp. Now that I think about it, isn't it weird how fixated I used to be about 'knowing how to survive?' I hated it, actually, and I hated being away from home, and I didn't make any friends. </p>

<p>                I'd only been there a week, but somehow by the end of it, it felt like I'd been there my whole life. It was like only my lonely life at camp pretending I liked learning to pitch tents was the real one, and everything I'd lived up to that point had been some kind of passing dream. I was so miserable when I was there it felt like I'd never be happy again. But when I finally went home, just a few days was all it took for my horrible experience at camp to be the bad dream. </p>

<p>                Right now, it's the same thing. Just more intense. More profound. More painful. I'd spent so long as some kind of half-spirit that couldn't even sleep that I can't begin to guess how long it's been since I'd been in a bed. But I <em>just woke up in one</em>, startled, because I'd been too tired to even remember how I got there. It's just funny I guess. I'd been craving a bed "all day." I've been craving having any slice of humanity all "my life." And here I come, to Sussurokawa, and remember I had my whole other life. My real life. And in so many ways, in any sane kind of existence, my time wasting away in the Tower of Tattle should be considered the 'fake life.'</p>

<p>                So, here I am now, staring at the ceiling of my room. I didn't even get to 'go to' bed. I just woke up in one all of a sudden -- at least from my perspective. And I realize what I'm wishing for desperately is that everything else, every tragedy in my life that I don't even remember the details of, every tragedy in my life that, from my "relived" perspective is actually <em> about to happen</em>... I hope with all this stupid futility that they're just dumb nightmares that lasted way, way, way too long. I look at Shiori's sleeping face, and I get to live out that little fantasy of denial, imagining how I'll tell her in the morning about the my awful nightmare. </p>
                
<p>                But then I see Yorick asleep right next to her and I know. I'm forced to know. All my past is real, and the only future I can see ahead of me is so fake you can't even call it a future. It's just the same old VHS tape, now on rewind. </p>

                <hr>

                <p>"She carried me to bed?" I ask, incredulously. I mean, that's the only explanation that makes any sense of course, but... imagining my mom doing anything that tender seeming just throws me for a loop. "Did she hit my head against any walls on purpose? Pinch me anywhere to vent her frustration?"</p>

                <p>Shiori just shakes her head earnestly at my dumb joke. "Nope. She even kissed your forehead goodnight."</p>

                <p>I feel myself blanching at the thought. Is it embarrassing? Not even. I literally can't believe it happened. At least not emotionally. "You should've filmed it then. Got a camcorder? Maybe we'll get a shot of Big Foot, too?"</p>

                <p>"I've tried...  But he's really shy," Shiori says matter-of-factly. "But um, all that said. What exactly are we doing right now? Why are we spying on your mom?"</p>

                <p>"We're not. Why would you say that?"</p>

                <p>"We're looking at her through binoculars..."</p>
            
                <p>"I'm not spying on her. I'm just looking at her. And um, all the other people who live on Rumeuri Hill. When else are we gonna get a chance to see them all together?" I ask.</p>

                <p>"When you put it like that, it does make sense!" Shiori tilts her head in thought.</p>

                <p>Three days before the first murder, everyone who lived on Rumeuri Hill got together. This morning, my mom unceremoniously banged on my door saying we <em>both</em> were supposed to be up by now getting ready.</p>

                <p>My eyes shot open. I suddenly remembered. Everyone was at this party.</p>

                <p>Every murder victim. Alphonse Krabb, Hannah Crecer, Nick Otkropenko, and Kyrie and Clarie Stodakis.</p>

                <p>A lot of memories have been coming to me like a humid climate seems to get inside your clothes. You can just feel it percolating and sticking to you, and you can't tell the moisture in the air from your own sweat. So a lot of times I don't even have a 'flash' of memory. It's like I'll be in the some place or conversation, and the blanks just fill themselves in moment-to-moment, sometimes so seamlessly I don't even realize I 'unforgot.' </p>

                <p>But this one absolutely flashed into my brain, like someone decided to put the memory in a special place and leave a note I'd never miss.</p>

                <p>Carefully, thoughtfully, and highly <em>logically</em> I thought it over. </p>

                <p>That sudden and intense act of remembering can't simply be because this party had some big emotional event. Otherwise, the evil, awful, terrible seance we were at last night should have struck </p>

                <p>There's something important about this party. And something in this Tower wants me to remember it's important. We just have to suss it out. The nature of the party itself is a big hint.</p>

                <p>It's a celebration of the founding families of Rumeuri Hill. The Crecer Family, who cultivated the land. The Otkropenko family, who built the town's basic infrastructure. And the Stodakis family, who built the town's backbone, its economy of mining and fishing.</p>

                <p>Al... Al's just sort of a groundskeeper I guess? Everytime I ever asked as a kid, I'd always just hear "he's like everybody's grandpa." He used to take care of the lighthouse too, before a lot of its maintenance got automated, and before my mom took over the job.</p>

                <p>...Oh yeah. That's the last family. Mine. But I can't remember our family name. Our family discovered the land or something. My mom always sound so disinterested talking about it that I never cared either. </p>

                <p>Speaking of old history, Shiori and I looked through the snitch we got from Muto's house yesterday. It's... something.</p>

                                            <h3>Girl X's Diary II</h3>

                                        </div>
                                        For so many kids with 'heightened sense', the sure all lack 'common sense.' Especially the Keij≈ç Ch≈ç" (ÁµåÂ∏∏ËÅ¥) prodigy who anyone can see clear as day has never been taught to shut up. Not sure how she can stand her own grating voice with those sensitive ears of hers. 
                                
                                
                                        <br><br>
                                        Everyone's scared of her because she can 'hear their thoughts.' I wanted to test it out, so I told her I had a secret present for her wrapped in a box. Every time I was near her, I kept thinking the words "She's going to love this puppy I got her" as loud as I mentally could. She got all smug that I was 'finally paying my dues', and then she screamed when all the worms and crickets I got spilled out. 
                                        <br><br>
                                        The most incredible thing is if she'd been paying attention she could've heard the crickets chirping in the box. Astonishing. People are afraid of her ears?
                                
                                    </div>

                                            <h3>Girl X's Diary II</h3>
                                            <small>2</small>
                                        </div>
                                        The loud and annoying girl's sister has the "Keij≈ç Soku" (ÁµåÂ∏∏Ëß¶). She definitely does a lot of creepy things, like taking apart dolls... and action figures... and dead bugs. Also she collects animal fur and I've seen her just rubbing it between her hands for like... an hour. 
                                
                                        <br><br>
                                        But it's not scary because she's clearly just emotionally stunted. I guess I'm the only one who can see it. Probably her loud-mouth twin sister's been so annoying and emotionally overbearing since birth that's the only way she can handle it. She's so in tune with other people's emotions she doesn't have space for her own. 
                                        <br><br>
                                        That's why she just follows her sister around at the hip. Her sister can hear thoughts, but is too much of a brat to understand feelings. Meanwhile, she can feel <em>emotions</em> but that doesn't mean she actually <em>understands</em> feelings. They're just sensations to her, like the taste of chocolate or the color blue. 
                                
                                    </div>

                                        </div>
                                        Today the loud-mouth sister brought the quiet sister around to try and tagteam me. I guess she thinks if she can read my thoughts, and use her twin to gauge my feelings, then she's got all her bases covered. Wrong. Stupid. 
                                
                                        <br><br>
                                        I put all my heart and soul into manifesting the emotion of annoyance, which is pretty much all I ever feel when the loud-mouth sister is around. Then I got to enjoy watching the loud twin's eyes turn teary while her sister patiently and painstakingly described those emotions.
                                        <br><br>
                                        '<em>Her ears start ringing painfully the second she sees you.</em>' <br>'<em>Her eyes would rather stare at the sun than see your face one more second.</em>' <br>'<em>She feels pity when she sees you mess up, but feels you deserve it.</em>' <br>'<em>Right now, she's barely suppressing amusement and condescension. Tears are coming to her eyes.</em>' <br><br>God. It was great. 
                                
                                    </div>
                                </div>
                            <p>Unless it's all some huge coincidence, we've got a story that's starting to manifest here, because all these codex entries we're reading match too well to ignore. </p>

                            <p>Even if you just compare the entries one-to-one, you can hear it all as the notes start playing together. It doesn't take a genius to see that Girl X here is talking about whoever writes the 'Musings from a Certain Heiress.' The Heiress's Sister has the Keijo Soku. And here Girl X mentions that the 'loud-mouth sister' has the Keijo Cho. And The Heiress talks about the Netabare name. Which means if she's an heir to something, it's the Netabare lineage. </p>

                            <p>The Netabares way back when were already trying to reach The Root or Sophia, or <em>whatever</em> by finding a bunch of kids with super senses. Girl X was taken from her family. A bunch of children from Sussurokawa disappeared maybe. Or maybe they never existed in the first place. Then this whole Tower is made for getting to The Root. </p>

                            <p>I'm not saying I get every part of it, but the throughline is pretty clear. Sussurokawa was some kind of hunting ground for them. Oh yeah. And also they had a secret recipe for a potion to make people forget things. Wouldn't that be a convenient way to make a whole town forget the children you stole?</p>

                            <p>"So? What do you think?" I ask, having detailed the theory out to Shiori while scanning the party. I'm pretty good at multitasking actually. My mom's laughing a lot...</p>

                            <p>I peek out one side of the binoculars to look at Shiori just stretching Yorick out like spaghetti, and he seems pretty relaxed about it. I really do want to play with Yorick too... but you know what? She's been really really bad about sharing since she's become a kid again.</p>

                            <p>"It makes sense," she says thoughtfully. "Being able to do all this in secret would enhance the amplification effect you get from a reversed mana flow... And the Netabares specialized in secrets. Ironically, it's the only reason anybody ever kept up with their existence is because they were a fixture in the mache... machines... " </p>

                            <p>"Machinations." What's Hannah talking about with Nick? </p>

                            <p>"Yeah, yeah! The mecha-nations of so many secret societies." </p>

                            <p>"Secret societies? Like... you don't mean the Illuminati do you?" Huh. Al really does just work on crossword puzzles when he's bored. </p>

                            <p>"Uhuh. And the scary ones too. Lots of Gnostic cults. The Freemasons. And then the El Los Illuminados in Los Angeles. They're super scary. I remember this one time! They got these two guys from Brazil and just locked them up with masks and then -"</p>

                            <p>Shiori shudders and suddenly stops talking apparently having scared herself. She gets real quiet for a bit, but then she gives me a serious look -- always ill-fitting with her young body. </p>

                            <p>For some reason it makes me nervous to see it. So, I start looking through the binoculars again. My mom looks a little mad. What's new? Wait, is she looking for us? </p>

                            <p>"Y-you know. We don't have... a lot of time left. I think... um... maybe we should be doing something more useful," Shiory says, surprisingly bluntly. </p>

                            <p>"I already told you, this must be where everything starts. This party's got to be tied with the mu-"</p>

                            <p>"We're not trying to solve the murders though," Shiori says, firmer than usual. "W-we... that's not our job, you know? We just want to find your journals and get you out, remember?"</p>

                            <p>Doesn't my mom's outfit look kind of tacky today? That shade of red...</p>

                            <p>"We probably have to solve the murders to get my name and journal back," I shrug. I'm not even really looking at anything through the binoculars right now. But I can't bring myself to look at her straight. </p>

                            <p>Sometimes delivering a hard truth takes nonchalance, right? What are the chances we got warped back in time, through our memories, to the point right before a set of murders and the murders aren't involved? Shiori shouldn't have to relive anything. I shouldn't have to relive anything. But I doubt we have much of a choice.</p>

                            <p>I know it's really awkward but this is the only way I can think to deliver the bad news.</p>

                            <p>"You and I both know that's not what's going on M...Mu!" Shiori snaps. "Y-you're not spying on everyone right now because you think it's gonna help you solve some mystery! You know that!"</p>

                            <p>Shiori steps over and gently pulls the binoculars from my face. Maybe she's seen me looking longingly because she shoves Yorick in my hands to play with, while she looks at me with the utmost concern. I feel sort of vulnerable for some reason...</p>

                            <p>"I-I don't know what you're talking about," I stutter.</p>

                            <p>"These are <em>toy binoculars</em>," Shiori says sadly. "You miss everyone. I miss everyone. And we keep... getting pulled in. And it's almost all my fault. Whenever I'm near them, it's like I revert! But right now I can think clearly, a-and... I just... I don't think you're prepared for what comes next. Even if we can't, we h-have to try and get this done before the murders. A-and... we can't spend as much time around everyone anymore. Or we'll keep losing ourselves over and over."</p>

                            <p>The silence hangs between us for a while."</p>

                            <p>And I let go for just a moment, to hug Yorick to me just like a little kid would.</p>

                            <p>"You're... right."</p>
                                
                               <p>I feel stupid all of a sudden for not even noticing. I need to be looking for snitches right now. The murder's a sideshow we don't want to be in. We couldn't even handle a scary seance. And everyone, and my mom... are just part of a happy dream we have to leave before it becomes a nightmare. </p>

                               <p>I'd even resolved myself yesterday to remove myself emotionally. All night, I thought about what made this place so tempting and so <em>scary</em> as if thinking about it enough would make me immune to it.  </p>

                               <p>It would have been so much easier if I just hated Sussurokawa with all my heart...</p>

                               <p>But let's take an objective look. I'm hugging a big ball of slime like a teddy bear. I was just spying with toy binoculars, and last night I was basically excited by a sleepover. Every two seconds I seem to be having some sort of daughter-mother squabble, and right now Shiori and I even have ribbons in our hair because my mom wanted us to dress nice, and I'm not gonna lie some part of me wanted to throw a tantrum over it.</p>

                               <p>I guess the stupid binoculars were my way of begging the universe for compromise. If I couldn't be around them, then I could at least watch them from afar. See my mom a bit longer, for what might... be the last time. </p>

                               <p>But we can't afford to keep doing that. If there's any chance of finding a real future, I've gotta let go of the past.</p>

                               <p>"You're right, Shiori," I say again. "We need to figure out how to stay away from them. As much as it hurts."</p>

                               <p> "Y-yeah..."Shiori nods. She looks really antsy and I think she wants Yorick back. But she gave him to me so I'm gonna hug him like this for a while. </p>
